Excellence: in all we do.

Accreditation
Kettering University has been accredited since 1962 by The Higher Learning Commission and is a member of the North Central
Association of Colleges and Schools.
The programs in Chemical Engineering, Computer Engineering, Electrical Engineering, Engineering Physics, Industrial
Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering are accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission (EAC) of ABET.
The program in Applied Physics is accredited by the Applied Science Accreditation Commission (ASAC) of ABET.
The program in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) of ABET.
The Business program was accredited in 1995 by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

History
Kettering University‘s name honors Charles Kettering (1876-1958), a distinguished engineer, inventor, scientist, social
philosopher and humanitarian. Charles Kettering believed that both theoretical knowledge and practical experience are necessary
elements of an education. This belief made him an advocate for cooperative education in the earliest years of the twentieth
century. Our founders were among those influenced by Kettering‘s advocacy. From our earliest years our students have
benefited from moving back and forth between the practical requirements of work experience and the disciplined reflection
fostered in an academic environment.
We trace our origins to 1919 as the School of Automotive Trades, a school that provided night classes for factory workers in the
growing automotive industry in Flint, Michigan. Under the leadership of Albert Sobey, the school became the Flint Institute of
Technology in 1923. In 1924 Sobey created the school‘s first cooperative education program permitting alternating periods of
full-time academic work and full-time work in local factories in a four-year program.
Recognizing the potential of cooperative education to educate its engineers and managers, General Motors Corporation took over
the institute in 1926 and changed the name to General Motors Institute. In 1945, General Motors Institute added a senior thesis
requirement and became a degree-granting college while maintaining its full cooperative education program.
General Motors divested itself of ownership in 1982. Though fully independent of General Motors, we maintained part of our
old name until 1998, GMI Engineering and Management Institute. As an independent private college we expanded the number
and types of companies employing our co-op students, added master‘s degree programs, established new majors and replaced
GM financial support with tuition, donations and endowment income.
In changing our name to Kettering University in 1998, we carry the name of a man whose life represents who we are. Charles
Kettering was famous for his technical knowledge and inventions, was fascinated by ideas, respected human imagination and
believed that service was the purpose of education. We honor his legacy with our cooperative education program, studentcentered learning, faculty scholarship and preparation of students to be leaders in service to their professions and to society.

About Kettering University / 5

Campus
Facilities
The seven main buildings, Academic Building, Campus Center, the Connie & Jim John Recreation Center, C. S. Mott
Engineering and Science Center, Frances Willson Thompson Hall, the Innovation Center and the University Corner Building, are
set off by an attractively landscaped 85-acre campus. In addition, 85+ acres are available for future development.
The Academic Building is the “historical” center of the campus. It houses classrooms, science laboratories, computer
laboratories, the library, the Humanities Art Center, McKinnon Theatre, and instructional and administrative offices, comprising
a total floor space of nearly 400,000 square feet.
The Campus Center is the “activity” center for the campus. It houses Kettering Dinning Services, Sunset C-Store, BJ’s Lounge
& Grill, the Wellness Center, television studios, WKUF, Financial Aid, Admissions, Campus Safety, recycling center, student
activities areas and other administrative offices.
Kettering’s 70,000 square-foot Connie and Jim John Recreation Center, located just west of the Thompson Residence Hall, has a
full complement of aerobic, strength, and sports amenities, in addition to student and alumni lounges, making it the likely focus
of many student and alumni social and recreational activities. It houses a six-lane swimming pool, four multi-purpose regulation
basketball courts, four racquetball courts, and a 1/8 mile suspended indoor track. Other areas include an aerobics/dance room, a
free-weight room, and a fitness/exercise room that overlook the pool and gymnasium.
The C. S. Mott Engineering and Science Center has a total floor space of 130,000 square feet. The building houses Biochemistry,
Chemistry, Mechanical Engineering, and alternative energy and automotive laboratories. Student project areas are provided,
including the SAE garage.
Frances Willson Thompson Hall is the on-campus residence facility for Kettering University.The facility has four floors, and is
designed in a figure eight formation with two courtyards. It is divided into 17 units of 17-37 residents. Common spaces include
multiple lounges/lobbies, computer labs, a community kitchen, a gaming area and laundry facilities. Each resident room is
equipped with a single bed, desk and chair, wardrobe unit with shelves, and with a micro fridge and microwave. All rooms are air
conditioned, heated and have access to telephone, cable and internet. Most residents share a suite with another resident (two
private rooms connected by a door). Residents share community bathrooms, which are located at the intersections of each
hallway.
Campus Village Apartments, although not Kettering-operated, are located on Kettering property, and provide suite-style housing
for over 200 upper-class students. Students wishing to explore the Campus Village living option should call the Campus Village
rental office at (810) 232-4960.
The Innovation Center at Kettering University is an approximately 9,000 sf. multi-tenant laboratory facility that supports
scientific and technologically-based “start-up” companies that have a need for dedicated research laboratories in the first three to
four years of their existence. It consists of six laboratories that are capable of being divided into twelve intimate laboratories,
private offices, a conference/training room, business center, break area and private shower facilities. The Innovation Center is
the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Silver Certified building in Genesee County.
In addition to the food and catering services provided from the Campus Center, students and the surrounding community have the
option of eating at Einstein Bros. Bagels in the University Corner Building across the street from the Campus Center. The 2,500
square-foot building also houses a Flint Police Service Station.
Kettering facilities are accessible to the handicapped. The majority of the campus buildings are inter-connected for ease of
movement during inclement weather. Convenient parking is provided adjacent to all campus buildings.
Harris Fields
Harris Fields, adjacent to the Recreation Center, is the 25 acre sports complex for use by Kettering students. The rectangular
portion contains areas for two soccer fields or two flag football fields or two lacrosse fields. This section is lit by Musco Lighting,
the premier sports lighting company in the world. Softball can be played on 4 fields, complete with backstops and crushed
limestone infields. Lacrosse and soccer also utilize the outfields for club practices and games. Informal play, the popular IM
Sports program and club sports all utilize Kettering Park. Students, faculty and staff are also active on the .62 mile (1K)
walking/jogging path that circumscribes the sports fields.
The McKeachie picnic pavilion is a covered picnic area that features picnic tables, barbeque grilles, lighting and electrical power
for student reserved or informal use. Adjacent to the pavilion are two sand volleyball courts that are very popular with students
for IM play and pick up games. A synthetic grass golf green completes the outdoor recreational opportunities for students.

About Kettering University / 6

Numerous trees and shrubs have been planted and the complex is fenced in and the area bordering University Avenue features
faux wrought iron fencing and brick columns offering a distinctive look to one of the entrances to campus. The entire complex
provides a first class venue for student recreation.
The Flint River Trail is a paved trail running along the Flint River from downtown Flint to the northern edge of Flint and on to
either Bluebell Beach or Stepping Stone Falls. The trail is almost continuously asphalt and is suitable for walking, jogging,
and/or biking and passes through the Kettering campus.
Atwood Stadium
Atwood Stadium has been an iconic landmark in the city of Flint for the past 85 years. Built on an old city dumpsite that was
cleared by 3000 local volunteers in a single day, it sits right in the heart of the Flint community. Atwood has played host to many
high school football games, including the Flint Northern/Flint Central series. It has also been the venue of choice for large-scale
community events, such as visits from President Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1936 and presidential candidate John F. Kennedy
in 1960. Today, activities include all levels of youth football, health fairs, band competitions, and 10k road races.
In September 2013, Kettering University stepped up to the plate and assumed ownership of the venerable stadium in order to
keep the facility from closing. Kettering is committed to maintain the traditional uses of the stadium in addition to providing a
new venue for Kettering student recreational and academic events. Fundraising has already started to enable major upgrades to
the facility including a new high-tech synthetic playing surface to replace the outdated existing AstroTurf.
The Kettering University Alumni Carillon (Bell Tower)
The Bell Tower also called Carillon was erected as a part of the campus expansion in 1969, built with funds donated by
GMI/Kettering Alumni and friends.. At the dedication, it was noted that the structure would “serve as a dynamic symbol of
identity between the alumni, students, and faculty”. The carillon consists of 47 bells arranged in four octaves. The largest bell
weighs nearly one ton while the smallest bell weighs only 20 pounds. The bells, made of 75 percent copper and 25 percent tin,
were cast by the 200-year-old Petit & Fritsen Foundry of Aarle-Rixtel Netherlands. Designed by Tarapata-McMahon-Paulson
Associates, the Kettering Carillon received the 1971 Honor Award for design from the Detroit Chapter of the American Institute
of Architects.

Admissions / 7

ADMISSIONS
Admission to Kettering University is competitive. Kettering’s Office of Undergraduate Admissions evaluates student credentials
to determine who is best qualified to pursue a degree in any of the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) or
business programs offered at the university. Emphasis is placed on the applicant’s overall academic record, including their grades
in core academic courses (English, science and math) and scores on college entrance exams. However, Kettering uses a holistic
approach to admission, so consideration is also given to the student’s personal essay, extracurricular activities, letters of
recommendation, employment history and other evidence of achievement and motivation. Kettering does not discriminate by
reason of race, color, sex, creed, age, physical challenge or national origin.
Applicants must possess a high school diploma or recognized equivalency. They should have achieved high scholastic standing –
especially in science, mathematics and English. Applicants for freshman admission must have completed sixteen credits in a
college preparatory program for grades nine through twelve. Credits given in eighth grade for ninth grade algebra and recorded
on their official high school transcript may be used as one credit of algebra.
Scholastic Preparation
To be eligible for admission, a student must complete the following courses prior to enrollment:
English:
Mathematics:
Science:

Six semesters required (eight semesters recommended)
Algebra – four semesters
Geometry – two semesters
Trigonometry – one semester
Four semesters of science with lab including two semesters of either Chemistry or Physics. Both
are strongly recommended.

We encourage all applicants to complete English, science, and math courses beyond these minimum requirements. Training and
experience in mechanical drawing, computer aided design (CAD) and personal computers are also recommended.
Beyond these minimum requirements, Kettering does not have a fixed formula for determining admission. However, a strong
record of academic achievement is expected. A separate GPA will be calculated for English, math and science coursework for all
students. Additional review may be required for any high school courses completed online.

College Entrance Examinations
Applicants for freshman admission are required to present scores for either the SAT or ACT. Scores should be sent directly to
Kettering University from the testing agency. Students are encouraged take either examination during their junior year and again
in the fall of the senior year. Kettering University will “super-score” all test results. Students for whom English is a second
language are strongly encouraged to present the results of the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). Kettering’s ACT
code is 1998, and our CEEB code for the SAT and TOEFL is 1246.

Freshman Applicants
Students are encouraged to apply online. Kettering University is a member of the Common Application. Students may apply
using either the Common Application at www.commonapp.org or Kettering University’s application. Applicants must then
request official transcripts and supporting information from their high school guidance offices. All post-secondary institutions
attended should be listed regardless of intention to transfer credits to Kettering. If you have any questions regarding the
application process, please call the Office of Undergraduate Admissions at 810-762-7865.
Early application – in the fall of senior year of high school – is encouraged to maximize the student’s visibility in the cooperative
and experiential education employment search process. High school seniors are encouraged to apply by the dates listed at
www.kettering.edu/admissions. However, Kettering University offers rolling admission and students may apply at any time
during the year. Their completed application, official transcripts, test results and supplemental materials – including personal
essay and recommendation letter – must be received in order for processing and evaluation to occur. All credentials submitted
become part of a permanent file at Kettering University. They cannot be returned to the applicant nor forwarded to any other
institution.
Enrollment is contingent upon satisfactory performance in, and completion of, all senior-level courses in which the student is
enrolled. Final high school and college transcripts must be submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions. Failure to do so

Admissions / 8

will affect your ability to register for classes. Applications for admission are valid for one year; students applying to Kettering
University, but not enrolling, may request reactivation of their application during that time.

Home School Student Applicants
Kettering University welcomes home schooled students to apply for admission. Applicants must submit the same application
materials and meet the same admission requirements as any other high school student. Students should submit a completed
application, standardized test scores, personal essay, letter of recommendation, and an official transcript developed by a home
school association or by the primary teacher.
All transcripts should include: course name, credit and final grade for all 9-12 grade courses, graduation date, and a signature
affirming that the transcript is the official record of academic studies. If any high school credit was earned in a formal high
school setting or college, the applicant must also supply an official transcript from the respective school. Courses taken online or
through correspondence programs should be similarly documented. For evaluation purposes we encourage clear documentation
and explanation of all English, math, and science courses. The Office of Undergraduate Admissions will contact the student’s
primary educator if additional information is needed.
Please note that all materials sent as part of the application become the property of Kettering University and will not be returned
to the student. Final transcripts showing a high school graduation date and/or final college transcripts must be submitted by all
incoming students. Failure to do so will affect your ability to register for classes.

International Student Applicants
Students who reside outside of the United States are welcomed to apply for admission to Kettering University. International
students should apply online. Admission decisions will be based on academic achievements in secondary school or university
studies. International students must submit at least one of the following test results: SAT, ACT, Test of English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL), or International English Language Testing System (IELTS). TOEFL or IELTS results are required from
students whose native language is not English, or who did not attend a school where English was the language of instruction.
Certified copies of transcripts/educational certificates and records with English translations must be sent to World Education
Services (WES) at www.wes.org for evaluation when the application for admission to Kettering University is submitted. A
secondary school/university-level grading scale may also be requested. All international students must provide a financial plan
for tuition, a personal essay, and one letter of recommendation before a final admission decision can be determined. Kettering
University does offer a limited number of scholarships to international students.
Immigration Information: F-1 Student Visa Applicants
Admitted international students will receive an I-20 form with their official letter of admission. All international students are
required to present the I-20 when applying for an F-1 Student Visa and again at their port of entry into the United States.
Applicants enrolled at another U.S. institution with an F-1 Student Visa must be released from the Student & Exchange Visitor
Program (SEVIS) by their current institution before Kettering University can issue a new I-20 form.
Co-op Employment of International Students
Degree seeking international students are required to participate in Kettering’s cooperative and experiential education program.
Students may secure co-op employment in the U.S. or in their home country. As is the case for domestic students, international
students are responsible for work term living expenses, transportation and any personal expenses.

Transfer Student Applicants
Kettering University is transfer-friendly and encourages students with prior college experience to apply for admission. Students

who have taken any college courses after graduation from high school are considered transfer students.
Transfer students must submit official transcripts from all colleges/universities attended. Additional information, such as high
school transcripts or SAT/ACT scores, may also be required from students who have completed less than 30 credit hours. A list
of courses in progress and the catalog(s) with course descriptions from each college attended may also be requested.
Kettering University has formal articulation agreements with more than 40 colleges/universities, ensuring the transferability of
approved courses upon their satisfactory completion. Students who successfully complete the equivalent of the first two years of
Kettering courses are generally able to complete their Kettering University degree and associated co-op work experiences within
three years.

Admissions / 9

Scholastic Preparation
To be eligible for admission to Kettering University, transfer students must complete the following courses prior to enrollment
(some of these requirements could have been completed at the high school level):
English:
Mathematics:
Science:

Six semesters required (eight semesters recommended)
Algebra – four semesters
Geometry – two semesters
Trigonometry – one semester
Four semesters of science with lab including two semesters of either Chemistry or Physics.
Both are strongly recommended.

Academic Requirements for Transfer Students
Beyond the above minimum scholastic requirements, Kettering does not have a fixed formula for determining admission.
However, a strong record of academic achievement is expected. Primary consideration is given to the applicant’s overall grade
point average and number of credit hours taken. A separate GPA will also be calculated for English, mathematics and science
coursework. Secondary consideration is given to the student’s employment history, extracurricular activities and honors, and
other evidence of ability, achievement and motivation.
A typical transfer student will have pursued 14-16 credit hours per semester of coursework similar to what is taken by a Kettering
University student. Candidates who have not pursued full-time collegiate study and/or followed a program that does not include
the extensive study of mathematics and science will be evaluated individually on their high school and college records and their
ACT/SAT test scores.
Prospective transfer students should maintain an overall grade point average of at least a “B,” with strong math and science
grades – again of at least a “B” or better. Kettering University offers rolling admission and students may apply at any time during
the year.
Suggested Courses
Transfer courses should reflect a strong background in math and science and can include general education classes common to
undergraduate degree programs.

employers starting as early as January. Careful attention is given to the student’s objectives, needs and preferences, as well as to
employer criteria.
Companies choose to interview applicants based on academic performance, class rank, employment history and extracurricular
activities and honors. Factors influencing final selection include communication skills, leadership potential, a desire for a career
in the industry, and the capacity to acquire the necessary academic and practical background for a future position of
responsibility. Information concerning the interviewing process is available from the Cooperative and Experiential Education
Office at 810-762-9846.

•
Students may contact the Financial Aid Office in Room 4-700 CC between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m.
(Monday - Friday) for specific details regarding eligibility, application procedures, deadlines, and required documents.
In addition to cooperative education earnings, there are three basic types of financial assistance for students: gift aid, loans and
campus employment. While these are described below, the Kettering University Website contains detailed information about
these awards.

Gift Aid Sources
•

Federal Pell Grant : The amount of Federal Pell Grant funds that a student receives is based on the number of credit
hours the student enrolls for and his or her Expected Family Contribution as determined by the Federal Methodology
needs analysis formula.

•

Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (SEOG) may be awarded by the Kettering
University Financial Aid Office to undergraduate students who demonstrate exceptional financial need.

•

Michigan Competitive Scholarships: Awarded by the Michigan Department of Education. The scholarships are based
on academic requirements and financial need. Students must initially qualify for the scholarship before enrolling as
college freshmen. The scholarship is renewable for a maximum of ten semesters, with renewal based on continued need
and satisfactory academic progress. Recipients must file the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) each
year prior to the State of Michigan deadline of March 1.

•

Endowed Scholarships: Some scholarships are open to a wide spectrum of students, while others have specialized
criteria. Questions regarding eligibility, scholarship guidelines, and the application process and deadlines should be
directed to the Financial Aid Office. A full listing and general descriptions may be accessed online at
https://www.kettering.edu/financialAid/upperclass-scholarships

Loan Assistance
•

Federal Direct Subsidized Loan: A need based, low interest loan for students. The amount that a student may borrow
is based on his or her grade level and amount of financial need. The annual loan maximums based on the student’s
grade level are as follows: Grade level 1 - $3500; Grade level 2 - $4500; Grade level 3-5 - $5500; Graduate students $8500. Repayment of the loan begins six months after the borrower ceases to be a half-time student. An origination fee
is deducted from the approved loan amount prior to disbursement. This fee is subject to change.

•

Federal Direct Unsubsidized Loan: A non-need based loan for students. A student must apply for a subsidized
Federal Direct Stafford/Ford Loan before requesting an unsubsidized loan. The combination of subsidized and
unsubsidized loans borrowed may not exceed the student costs and the annual limits of the William D. Ford Federal
Direct Loan Program. In addition to the subsidized loan maximums listed above, students considered to be dependent
can apply for an additional amount of $2,000 per academic year. Students considered Independent can apply for

Financial Aid / 14

additional amounts through the unsubsidized program as follows: Grade level 1 - $4,000; Grade level 2 - $4,000; Grade
level 3-5 - $5,000; Graduate students - $12,000. The interest rate is variable with a cap of 8.25% and is the borrower’s
responsibility. An origination fee is deducted from the approved loan amount prior to disbursement. This fee is subject
to change.
•

Federal Direct PLUS Loan: A non-need based loan that is available to the parents of dependent students. The parent
borrower must have a favorable credit history. The amount that a parent may borrow is based on the student’s
educational costs, minus any other financial aid received. The student does not need to apply for other types of need
based financial aid, but is encouraged to do so. The interest rate is variable with a cap of 9% and must be paid by the
parent. Repayment of the loan begins on the date of disbursement. An origination fee is deducted from the approved
loan prior to disbursement. This fee is subject to change. Note: If a parent is denied a PLUS Loan due to an unfavorable
credit decision from the Direct Loan Servicer, the Dependent student can access the higher amounts available to
Independent students through the Unsubsidized Federal Direct Stafford Loan Program listed above.

•

Alternative Student Loan Programs. These programs are intended to provide students and their families an alternate
source of loan funds to assist in meeting the cost of postsecondary education. Contact the Financial Aid Office for
further details.

On-Campus Student Employment
Federal Work Study (FWS) is a program that assists Kettering University in providing on-campus employment for students
with demonstrated need.
Campus employment is available on a limited basis to students without financial need who would like to earn money toward
educational cost while attending school.

Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP)
In order to maintain financial aid eligibility, you must make Satisfactory Academic Progress (SAP) toward obtaining a degree.
Satisfactory Academic Progress will be monitored at the end of each academic term whether or not you have received financial
aid. This policy applies to all federal, state, and university funded grants, along with some alternative loans.
Minimum standard requirements:
•
Qualitative Measure (GPA that a student must achieve at each evaluation): Must maintain a cumulative grade point
average (GPA) of at least 2.0 at the end of each academic term.
•

Quantitative Measure (Pace of progression to ensure completion within the maximum time frame): Students must
successfully earn 67 % of all credits attempted during an academic term. An "I" will be calculated as no credit until it
reverts to a letter grade and is posted to the student's academic record.
•
•
•
•
•

•

Credits attempted are defined as all classes for which a student receives a passing grade (“D” or better), or an
“F”, “W” or “I”.
Credits completed are defined as all classes for which a student receives a passing grade of “D “or better.
Audit credits do not count as credits attempted or completed.
Repeated Courses count as credits attempted during each term the student is enrolled in the course; however they
will be counted once as credits completed the first time a passing grade is received for the course.
Transfer Credits count towards the quantitative measure.

Maximum Time Frame to Complete a Degree: The maximum allowable timeframe for receiving aid is equal to 150
percent of the length of your academic program. If you are a transfer student, your accepted transfer coursework will be
counted in the maximum timeframe.

Financial Aid Warning
Students who fail to meet the minimum standards for satisfactory academic progress at the end of the academic term will be
placed on financial aid warning. A student may continue to receive financial aid for one semester while on financial aid warning.
Students should use this opportunity to re-establish satisfactory academic progress.
If, at the end financial aid warning period, the student is meeting the minimum requirements for satisfactory academic progress,
the financial aid warning is lifted.

Financial Aid / 15

Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after the financial aid warning semester will be ineligible for financial
aid. You may appeal this status. If your appeal is approved, your financial aid eligibility will be reinstated, and you will be
placed on Probation for one term. If your appeal is denied, your financial aid will be suspended for the next academic term.
Financial Aid Probation
To be on Financial Aid Probation you would have to successfully appeal not making Satisfactory Academic Progress after a
Financial Aid Warning term. Student may receive aid for one more academic term if appeal is granted.
If, at the end financial aid probation period, the student is meeting the minimum requirements for satisfactory academic progress,
the financial aid probation is lifted.
Students who fail to make satisfactory academic progress after the financial aid probation semester will be ineligible for financial
aid and placed on Financial Aid Suspension.
Financial Aid Suspension
If the financial aid office determines that you have not met the Minimum Standard Requirements to receive Financial Aid, and
your appeal is denied you will not be eligible to receive aid for your next period of enrollment.
Appeal
If extenuating circumstances exist which caused a student to fail to meet one of the above standards, a written appeal may be
submitted. Examples of extenuating circumstances include, but are not limited to: unexpected death or major hospitalization of
an immediate family member, extended hospitalization or medical condition of student, house fire victim of a violent crime. The
appeal should address and document these extenuating circumstances AND include:
•
•

Why you failed to make Satisfactory Academic Progress
What has changed that will allow you to make Satisfactory Academic Progress during your next academic term

The appeal form is available on the Financial Aid Website. The appeal form must be turned into the Financial Aid Office within
thirty days of the notification that you are not meeting Satisfactory Academic Progress. Appeals must include supporting
documentation. Incomplete appeals or those missing adequate documentation are typically denied.
Those suspended due to attempting credits more than the 150% of the program are not eligible for appeal.

Withdrawing from Courses
Financial aid is based on the number of credits for which students are enrolled at the end of the refund period. Students who are
not registered for full-time at that point will have aid reduced accordingly. Students are encouraged to meet with a financial aid
advisor prior to making withdrawal decisions.

Withdrawing from Kettering
For financial aid purposes there are two types of withdrawals: complete and unofficial.
•
Complete: Official withdrawal from the University by the student.
•
Unofficial: Federal financial aid regulations consider a student to be an unofficial withdrawal if the student receives all
fail (E) grades or a combination of all fail (E) and withdraw (W) grades for the term.

Student Fails to Earn a Passing Grade in any Class
Never Attended: If a student receives a grade of an F due to not attending class, Federal Title IV aid will be adjusted for those
classes never attended.
•
Example: A student is in four classes which are all four credit classes. The student receives three A grades and one F
grade. The instructor reported that the student never attended the class that received the F grade. Aid will be adjusted
from 16 credits (full time) to 12 credits (three-quarter time).
•
Example: If a student receives only the following grades (F or W) without one passing grade. If attendance has not
been achieved up through the 60% point of the semester, a calculation is done to determine the amount of the Title IV
funds that the student has earned at the time of withdrawal.

Financial Aid / 16

Why do we monitor students receiving all ‘F’ grades?
The school is obligated by federal regulation to review aid recipients receiving all ‘F’ grades. The assumption behind the law is
that a student receiving all ‘F’ grades walked away from the semester without properly withdrawing from the
University. Schools must identify students with ‘F’ grades within 30 days from the date final grades are posted.

Withdrawing Prior to Completing 60% of Term
Unless a student completes 60% of the term in which federal aid was disbursed, the student will be required to return all or part
of the financial aid disbursed in the term. This applies to students who have officially (including medical), or unofficially
withdrawn.
Student Financial Aid Enrollment Requirements
Kettering University is a semester-based University with two semesters. Each semester consists of an academic term and a work
term.
•
July-December is a semester (includes summer and fall terms).
•
January-June is a semester (includes winter and spring terms).
Student aid, by law, is paid in semesters. Therefore, students who participate in non-standard enrollment (for example, attending
school for two terms July-December and then working January-June) may experience decreased financial aid eligibility.
•
Enrollment patterns that will not affect aid eligibility for traditional A-section students include the first and second
examples on the chart below.
•
Enrollment patterns that will not affect aid eligibility for traditional B-section students include the third and fourth
examples on the chart below.
In summary, enrollment patterns that create problems include two academic terms within one semester.

NOTE: Students may, according to special needs by their employer, follow other patterns of academic/co-op terms. Students
wishing to work three consecutive work terms may do so but will be listed inactive (not a student) for one of the three terms. A
student must demonstrate progress toward a degree by attending two academic terms within a given year. Send a written request
to the Registrar if interested in pursuing this option.

Financial Suspension
Failure to meet financial obligations or agreements with Kettering University may result in financial suspension. Financial
suspension, determined by the Business Office, includes suspension from portions of or all privileges to which active students are
entitled. Two privileges include issuance of transcripts and processing of current and future course registrations.

Tuition and Fees / 17

TUITION AND FEES
Expenses
The current tuition, fees, and charges are listed below. The Student Accounts Office will send an e-mail notification one month
prior to the term to your Kettering e-mail when your official bill is ready to view on Banner Web/Self Service. All tuition and
fees are due by the beginning of each academic term and all financial aid arrangements must be made by the end of the first day
of classes.
To help you meet expenses, we have teamed with Nelnet Business Solutions (NBS, formerly known as FACTS Management
Company) to enable you to more easily budget your education expenses and expanded the e-Cashier Tuition Payment Plan
(hereafter, "e-Cashier"). e-Cashier gives you the option of monthly payments to help make the cost of higher education as
affordable as possible.
e-Cashier offers a variety of online payment options, including payment in full or monthly budget payments over 2 to 6 months.
Payments are processed via a credit card or automatic bank payments from checking or savings accounts. There is no fee on a
payment in full when drawn from your checking or savings account. If, however, you elect to make payment in full using the
credit card option, your full payment along with a 2.5% convenience fee is charged to the Visa, Discover, MasterCard, or
American Express credit card you designate.
e-Cashier gives you a convenient, interest-free way to budget education expenses. Instead of having to pay the tuition at the
beginning of each term or going into debt, you may budget tuition and other expenses over 2 to 6 months per term. Because
e-Cashier is not a loan program, there is no debt, no credit search, and no interest or finance charge assessed by NBS on the
unpaid balance. The only cost is a $25 per term non-refundable enrollment fee to enroll in a payment plan (if, however, you elect
the credit card option, your monthly payment along with a 2.5% convenience fee will be automatically charged to the credit card
you designate).
Please visit e-Cashier for information on a variety of online payment options including payment in full or monthly budget
payments over 2 to 6 months. The payments will be automatically deducted from whichever account you choose. A $300 late fee
will be added to all accounts which have not been settled in full by 4:00 p.m. fourth week Friday of each academic term.
Financial aid is available for students with a demonstrated need; sources of aid are discussed in the Financial Aid section of this
catalog. NOTE: International Students – Payment in full of the total balance due must be made by 4:00 p.m. third week Friday
of each academic term. Students who do not comply with this policy will be dropped and separated from the university. The
separated students’ visa program will be terminated in SEVIS by fourth week Wednesday.

Tuition
For purposes of determining financial aid, a full academic load at Kettering University is considered to be 15 credit hours.
Kettering University has a fixed rate tuition and fee plan for full-time students that began with the 2012-2013 academic year.
Simply put, Kettering students and their parents will be able to rely upon the tuition rate at the University remaining level for the
remainder of each student’s full-time study at Kettering. And the tuition rate is inclusive of all tuition-related University fees.
Our reason for “fixing” tuition was simple – to take away the guesswork involved in college costs. The Kettering fixed tuition
plan means that college costs for the entire program are predictable. Rather than giving you a quick one year peek at college
costs, we give to you the complete picture. While other universities will no doubt raise tuition every year – creating significant
cost increases over the time to a degree – at Kettering those costs will remain stable.
Simultaneously, we are affirming our commitment to providing superb undergraduate programs in science, technology,
engineering, mathematics and business with a rigorous experiential education component. All of us at the University are
dedicated to ensuring that every element of your education here is rooted in excellence – whether that be in the classroom, the
laboratories, or on the playing fields and in the gym.

STUDENT LIFE
Student Conduct: Behavioral Standards
Ethics in the University
The mission of Kettering University rests on the premise of intellectual honesty; in the classroom, the laboratory, the office, and
at the examination desk. The very search for knowledge is impaired without a prevailing ethic of honor and integrity in all
scholarly, professional, and personal activities. The principles of honor and integrity make it possible for society to place trust in
the degrees we confer, the research we produce, the scholarship we present and disseminate, and the critical assessments we
make of the performance of students. In order to achieve our goals of preserving, disseminating, and advancing knowledge,
Kettering University expects all members of the community to be open to new ideas, to be governed by truthfulness, and to be
considerate of the rights of others. We strive to foster these values in all our endeavors and will employ all possible means to
discourage dishonest behavior in any form. We hold students accountable for their choices and actions through the Code of
Student Conduct, administered by the Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students.
Academic Integrity
We believe fairness, openness, and intellectual honesty to be the keystones of our educational mission. We foster these qualities
in all our endeavors and use all possible means to discourage dishonesty, in any form. All members of the Kettering community
should report academic dishonesty to the appropriate faculty person, as well as to the Vice President of Student Life & Dean of
Students. Academic dishonesty prohibited at Kettering includes, but is not limited to, the following forms:
Cheating
Intentionally using or attempting to use unauthorized materials, information, or study aids in any academic exercise.
Fabrication
Intentional and/or unauthorized falsification or invention of any information or citation in an academic exercise.
Facilitating Academic Dishonesty
Intentionally or knowingly helping or attempting to help another to engage in academic dishonesty in any form.
Plagiarism
Intentionally or knowingly representing the words, ideas, or images of another as one’s own in any academic exercise.
Students found to have carried out any form of academic dishonesty are subject to the faculty member’s scrutiny and sanctions,
as well as Judicial Affairs’ policies and procedures.
Kettering Code of Student Conduct
The Kettering University Code of Student Conduct represents a body of behavioral standards for all students. These standards
are strictly and vigorously enforced by Kettering University to ensure members of this educational community a productive, safe,

mature individuals while on campus, at home, and in their work-section communities.
Students are expected to comply with all University regulations governing student conduct and the use of University property and
facilities. Kettering University has the right to take action and investigate any offense that involves our students, either as victims
reporting or students accused of violating the Code of Student Conduct or any federal, state, and/or local laws/ordinances. The
Code of Student Conduct extends to students at their places of co-op employment. We expect students to honor their co-op
employer’s standards for workplace demeanor and may impose our Judicial Affairs procedures upon any student charged by an

Kettering University has the right to request a student return to campus during a work- or off-term in order to expedite a case
perceived as serious and pressing in nature. Students are entitled to the rights afforded by the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (FERPA).
Resolution Options
Administrative Hearing
In cases where charges do not appear to merit suspension or expulsion, or in cases which the accused does not contest
the charges, the Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students may designate an Administrative Hearing Officer
(AHO), usually the Chief Student Judicial Officer. The AHO will investigate the case and conduct a hearing with the
accused. Administrative Hearings accommodate all those rights and procedures accorded to students by the

Student Life / 21

University’s judicial policies. Following the hearing, the AHO will provide the student with written notification of the
results of the hearing, as well as information about the appeals process.
University Board of Student Conduct
The Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students designates a Judicial board, or University Board of Student
Conduct (UBSC) whenever charges may result in suspension or expulsion, including all cases involving academic
misconduct. In these cases, the Chief Student Judicial Officer of the University chairs the UBSC, comprised of a
minimum of three members of the Kettering community and including representatives from faculty, staff, and students.
The Chief Student Judicial Officer investigates the charges and prepares the case for presentation to the UBSC. All
presentations include resolution options. The UBSC makes recommendations to the Vice President of Student Life &
Dean of Students, who may endorse, alter, or dismiss them.
Other Resolution Options
The Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students may, after consultation with the involved parties, provide other
avenues of resolution, including mediation and/or conciliation.
Administrative and Judicial Board Hearings Decisions
All decisions will be based only on documents, testimony, and evidence presented at administrative and judicial board hearings.
Judicial Affairs Sanctions
The University has the right to enforce a variety of sanctions upon students who are found to have violated the Code of Student
Conduct. They include, but are not limited to, the following:
Creation of a Judicial File
The University applies this sanction whenever the Chief Student Judicial Officer or other hearing officer[s] uphold
charges against a student for violating the Kettering Code of Student Conduct, yet it appears that interviews and
counseling associated with the pre-hearing and hearing are sufficient to deter further violation. The Chief Student
Judicial Officer creates an official file detailing the student’s offense.
Judicial Warning
A Judicial Warning consists of a formal, written notice that the student has violated the Code of Student Conduct and
that any future violation will result in more serious consequences.
Restitution and/or Fines
When a violation of the Code of Student Conduct results in costs to other students, Kettering University, or others, a
student may be required to make restitution and/or pay a fine. The University applies fines to community endeavors.
Community Service
This sanction requires students to contribute a fixed number of hours, without compensation, to benefit the University
or the local community. The University retains the right to require that students complete community service with
particular organizations it specifies.
Judicial Probation
Judicial probation implies a medial status between good standing at Kettering, and suspension or expulsion. A student
on Judicial Probation will be permitted to remain enrolled at Kettering University under certain stated situational
conditions, depending on the nature of the violation and the potential learning value that may be derived from such
conditions. Usually, Judicial Probation extends over a stated period, during which it is clearly understood that the
student is subject to further disciplinary action, including suspension or expulsion, if the student violates the terms of
probation or in any way fails to conduct him/herself as a responsible member of the Kettering University community.
Judicial Probation serves as a final warning to the student to re-evaluate and modify his/her unacceptable behavior.
Students on Judicial Probation will not be allowed to represent the University in any formal manner and may not serve
in a student leadership position during the period of probation. Knowledge of a student’s Judicial Probation status may
be made known to others at the University on a need-to-know basis.
Interim Suspension and/or Altered Privileges
Kettering imposes interim suspension when it appears the accused poses a threat to him/herself or others at the
University. It may also be imposed following allegations of sexual or physical assault, drug use and/or distribution,
threats of violence, etc.
The Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students or designate may alter or suspend the privileges/rights of a
student to be present on campus and/or to attend classes for an interim period prior to the resolution of a judicial
proceeding. Decisions of this sort will be based upon whether the allegation of misconduct appears reliable and

Student Life / 22

whether the student’s continued presence reasonably poses a threat to the physical or emotional condition and/or wellbeing of any individual, including the accused student’s. Interim suspension may also be imposed when the accused
student’s continued presence appears to disrupt the University’s regular or special functions, or threatens the safety or
welfare of university property.
Interim suspension and/or altered privileges remain in effect until a final decision is made on a pending incident. The
Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students or designate may repeal interim suspension or altered privileges at
his/her discretion.
Suspension
Suspension—an involuntary separation of a student from Kettering University—implies and states a time for return to
the university. Suspension may extend for a school and/or work term, for a specified period, until a specified date, or
until a stated condition is met. A University Board of Conduct may recommend suspension, but only the Vice
President of Student Life & Dean of Students may impose it.
Expulsion
Expulsion—a permanent involuntary separation of a student from Kettering University—may be recommended by a
University Board of Conduct, but only the Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students may impose it.
Notification of Sanction to Co-Op Employers
The University has the right and responsibility to notify a student’s co-op employer whenever the student is found to
have violated the Kettering Code of Student Conduct.
Students’ Use of Technology
The use of any personal computational or communications devices in the classroom, not otherwise governed by University or
course policies, is subject to the approval of the instructor. This includes, but is not limited to, the use of calculators, computers,
personal digital assistants, text pagers, and cell phones. Any use of such devices without the instructor’s approval is prohibited.
The use of such devices without permission of the instructor may be considered disruptive behavior. Students who persist in
such activity may be subject to the University’s “Dismissal Due to Disruptive Behavior” policy.
The use of electronic devices to facilitate an act of academic misconduct, such as cheating or plagiarism, will be considered a
violation of the Code of Student Conduct and adjudicated by Judicial Affairs.
Students are expected to familiarize themselves with Kettering University’s Acceptable Use Policy, posted on the “Policies and
Standards” section of the Information Technology website (http://www.kettering.edu/it/policies_and_standards.jsp).
Dismissal from Class Due to Disruptive Behavior
Whenever an enrolled student’s presence or behavior in class disrupts the learning environment and, in the faculty member’s
opinion, undermines the best interests of the class and/or the student, the faculty member may request in writing (with a copy to
the appropriate Department Head) that the student be issued an administrative dismissal. The faculty member should discuss the
student’s behavior with the Vice President of Student Life & Dean of Students (VPSL) and/or her designate, who will meet with
the faculty member to discuss the alleged incident. The VPSL will also meet with the student to determine possible judicial
action after determining whether or not the student’s behavior violated the Kettering Code of Student Conduct. The VPSL will
either appoint a judicial officer to adjudicate the matter or refer it for action by a University Board of Student Conduct. If the
dismissal occurs by Friday of seventh week, student will receive a grade of W (withdrawal). If the dismissal occurs after Friday
of seventh week, student will receive a non-passing grade.
Harassment and Discrimination Policies
Kettering University expects all students, faculty, and staff to contribute to a productive learning environment by demonstrating
behavior that neither interferes with another individual’s performance nor creates an intimidating, offensive or hostile
environment. The University will not tolerate harassment or discrimination in any forms, regardless of intent and/or the victim’s
reaction.
Harassment
The University prohibits all sexual harassment and/or offensive conduct, on campus and in students’ work section communities.
Such conduct includes, but is not limited to, sexual flirtation, touching, verbal or physical advances or propositions; verbal abuse
of a sexual nature; graphic or suggestive comments about an individual’s dress or body; sexually degrading words to describe an
individual; the display, in the workplace, of sexually suggestive objects or pictures, including nude photographs. Behavior
constitutes sexual harassment when it is unwelcome and it interferes with the ability of another person to carry out his/her
responsibilities, creates a hostile work environment; or its expression implies that acceptance of the behavior is a condition of
course registration, course completion, course evaluation , or employment.

Cooperative and Experiential Education / 32

COOPERATIVE AND EXPERIENTIAL EDUCATION
Cooperative and Experiential Education is the key experiential learning component of Kettering University’s academic program.
It is best exemplified as a three-way partnership agreement between a student, an employer, and the university. The purpose of
the program is three-fold:
1.
2.
3.

To provide students with progressively more responsible and productive experiences related to, and consistent with
their academic program and professional goals.
To provide educational experiences which orientate and integrate students into productive and professional roles within
their respective work environments or to prepare them for the next level of their educational pursuits.
To develop positive work-related habits, characteristics, and transferable skills which promote professionalism,
leadership, ethical behavior, diversity and global awareness.

Requirements
Cooperative and Experiential Education at Kettering University is based on an alternating full-time schedule. Students alternate
11 week academic terms with 12 week terms of progressively challenging work with an authorized employer. Students will also
participate in professional development modules designed to integrate academic and work experiences at key points in their
progression.
Students who complete their academic requirement in nine full-time terms or more must complete at least five satisfactory work
terms at an authorized employer. Three of these five must occur after achieving Junior 1 status.
Students who complete their academic requirements in eight full-time terms (minimum of 16 earned credit hours per term) must
complete at least four satisfactory work terms at an authorized employer. Two of these four must occur after achieving Junior 1
status.
Students transferring to Kettering University with 24 or more earned hours (sophomore status) must complete at least four
satisfactory work terms at an authorized employer (three after attaining junior status). The work experience terms must be earned
while a Kettering University student.
Students transferring to Kettering University with 56 or more earned hours (junior status), without a baccalaureate degree, must
complete at least three satisfactory work terms at an authorized employer. The work experience terms must be earned while a
Kettering University student.
Students transferring to Kettering University with a baccalaureate degree must complete at least three satisfactory work terms at
an authorized employer. The work experience terms must be earned while a Kettering University student.

Academics
Students placed with a co-op employer are expected to be in good academic standing. Many employers have specific grade
requirements and it is the student’s responsibility to know what those requirements are, as well as any resulting consequences of
not meeting them. Students whose cumulative GPA falls below 2.7 may be in jeopardy of being released from their co-op
assignment. It is the students’ responsibility to submit their grades to their employer, if required. Students with poor academic
performance may be required to complete consecutive academic terms successfully before being allowed to search for
employment. Students should consult with their Cooperative Education Manager/Educator with questions about this process.

The Alternation Sequence
Each student assumes responsibility for maintaining satisfactory progress toward their degree. This includes following an
alternating sequence between school and work while they are enrolled (two school terms and two work terms per academic year).
This alternation schedule is determined based on the student’s section status (A or B section) noted below.
A-Section
Summer: School
Fall:
Work
Winter: School
Spring: Work

B-Section
Summer: Work
Fall:
School
Winter: Work
Spring: School

Cooperative and Experiential Education / 33

Any changes to this school/work sequence must be approved in advance through the petition process. Refer to the Academic
Policies and Regulations section of this catalog (Petition to Alter Academic/Work Sequence) more for information.

Continuous Growth
The cooperative education partnership is designed to achieve the educational and career goals of our students in conjunction with
meeting the future human resource needs of the co-op employers. Because co-op is an academic program, Kettering students are
encouraged to remain with the same employer throughout the entire program. Experience has shown that, in most cases, it is
more advantageous for the student to progress within one organization than to change from one to another. Each time a student
begins with a new organization, they start over in the learning process and are often given less responsibility until their learning
curve increases. Staying with the same organization throughout the entire program has proven to increase opportunities and the
responsibility level afforded to the student.
There are appropriate reasons for some students to request a new co-op employer or for an employer to terminate a student. This
process is referred to as Reassignment. Students seeking reassignment must meet with their Cooperative Education
Manager/Educator to help determine if the process is necessary. Kettering will approve reassignment after it has been
determined that it would be in the best interest of the student and the employer (see below: Changing Co-op Employers). It
should be recognized that changes in assignment are permitted, but are not granted solely on the basis of student financial gain,
personal commitments or assumed responsibilities. The intent of the cooperative relationship is to meet the goals of both the
student and the employer, but not at the expense of the other. A healthy respect for both is needed to maintain a successful
program.

Other Experiential Learning Opportunities
Kettering University offers an array of experiential learning opportunities that can be interchanged or used to greatly enhance the
co-op experiences of our students. The best examples of these experiences include:
•
•
•
•
•
•

On-campus co-op opportunities
Internships
Research opportunities
Entrepreneurship opportunities
Service Learning
Competitions

Students who are interested in integrating some of these options should work closely with their Cooperative Education
Manager/Educator; in conjunction with their degree departments.

Selection by a Co-op Employer
Resumes of eligible students are forwarded to co-op employers by the Cooperative Education staff, or a variety of other means
such as Co-op Employment Fairs, personal referrals, or through self selection via our Kettering Connect System, where
employers may post their positions on line for students to review. Careful attention is given to student objectives, interests, needs
and preferences. While most students obtain co-op employment through these efforts, students are equally encouraged to assist in
the process by initiating contact with potential co-op employers through their own personal networks. The Kettering Cooperative
Education staff will work with students who wish to pursue new co-op employers. All employers must be approved and entered
into our database in order for students to receive credit for their work terms.
Co-op employers choose to interview an applicant based on the student’s academic background, employment history, skills,
extracurricular activities and honors. Factors that may influence selection by a co-op employer include communication skills,
leadership potential, career interests, desire to work, and the capacity to acquire the necessary academic and practical experiences
that lead to greater responsibility.

Section Assignments
A-Section students begin school in July; B-Section students begin school in October. Kettering University assigns students into a
section based upon space and class-load balance. The University will attempt to meet student requests, but has the right to
determine section assignments. Co-op employers may also request section assignments for students based upon their co-op hiring
needs.

Cooperative and Experiential Education / 34

Registration
All students are automatically registered in their cooperative work experience term according to the alternation sequence.
Students are allowed to register for a maximum of eight credits of coursework while registered for a co-op or thesis term.

Grading System
To receive a Pass/Fail grade for a co-op work term, each student must have on file both the Supervisor and Student Evaluation of
the co-op experience and evidence of completion of a Work-Term Reflection. The supervisor’s evaluation of the student’s co-op
experience should be reviewed with the student and then signed by the employer. During a co-op work term, students generally
work full-time (40 hours) a week, and in some cases, required to work overtime or various shifts depending on the employers
needs. A student hired later than the start of the term, or released prior to the end of the term (except under extreme conditions)
must work at least six weeks (250 hours) of the twelve week term and receive a “satisfactory” grade to have their work
experience count toward graduation requirements.

Professional Development Modules
Cooperative and experiential learning is fully integrated in our academic and educational program and supports University
learning outcomes. Over the course of their academic career, students will participate in professional development modules
designed to allow them to reflect upon, plan for, and be intentional in their personal work experiences.

Work Experience Evaluations
The student’s performance during a cooperative work experience term is evaluated by the student’s supervisor, who is assigned
for that term by the co-op employer. This evaluation is required by Kettering and is kept on file for five years after graduation or
separation from the University. The terms are evaluated on a “satisfactory/unsatisfactory” grading format. No academic credit
hours or quality points are earned through the work experience requirements of the program.

Students Released From a Co-op Employer
Students released from an employer one or more times based upon performance may be required to complete a Skills
Performance Assessment and could be required to work on campus as they acquire personal and professional development skills
before returning to the work place. If a student is released due to grades, they may be required to take back-to-back school terms
with a reduced number of credits to improve their academic standing.

Changing Co-op Employers
It is mandatory that students work at least two work terms with an employer and have given their best to be a responsible
employee before they petition for reassignment. Students desiring a change in co-op employer must meet with their Kettering
University Cooperative Education Manager/Educator to discuss the reason(s) for the request. Requests for reassignment must be
approved by the Cooperative Education Manager/Educator or Review Team. If it is determined that reassignment is the best
option, prior notification to their current employer will be necessary before a new job search process is initiated. Students should
not initiate a discussion with a prospective new employer without the knowledge and approval from the Cooperative and
Experiential Education Office.
It should be emphasized that any deviation from this policy, or unilateral student action, to secure a new co-op employer without
prior approval may result in that student jeopardizing receiving work experience credits for graduation and/or being placed on
probation. It is imperative that we maintain good relationships with our employer partners, in addition to assisting students in
successfully negotiating change.
The Cooperative and Experiential Education Office will assist students who are granted permission to seek new co-op
employment. All students available for reassignment will be given access to the current co-op database, enabling their resume to
be sent to co-op employers currently seeking students with similar profiles (academic major, skills, etc.).

The Reassignment Process
The Reassignment Committee will consider all reassignment requests on a case-by-case basis. In order to submit requests for
reassignment, students must follow these steps:

Cooperative and Experiential Education / 35

•
•
•

Make an appointment with the Cooperative Education Manager/Educator before pursuing reassignment, preferably at
the beginning of a term.
The Cooperative Education Manager/Educator will work with the student to determine if reassignment is the right step.
If pursuing reassignment is agreed upon, the student will fill out all necessary forms, which include:
•
Reassignment Employment Request/Authorization Form.
•
Reflection Form (for terminations).
•
Provide written documentation explaining reason(s) for the reassignment request.
•
Student Obligation Form (if necessary).
•
Employer Notification - This is a formal resignation letter (if necessary).
•
Ensure copies of the following are accurate and up-to-date:
•
All evaluations, both student and employer, are complete.
•
Current transcripts.
•
Updated resume.

The Cooperative Education Manager/Educator or Review Team will preview all submitted materials and make a decision. The
Cooperative and Experiential Education Office is prepared to help guide and assist all students as they continue to grow with
their organizations and move toward graduation. The student is encouraged to contact their Cooperative Education
Manager/Educator for advice and counsel before making any change to their cooperative education program.

Transfer of Work Experience
Students who have participated in other comparable college-level cooperative work experience programs or who believe they
have significant work experiences related to their Kettering degree program may be eligible to transfer this work experience
toward their Kettering degree requirements. Students wishing to pursue such action should contact the Cooperative and
Experiential Education Office to determine the documentation necessary to transfer a maximum of two work experiences. These
work experiences will apply toward the student’s freshman and sophomore level experiences only.

Students without a Co-op Employer
Students who are not employed by the start of their work term are allowed to continue in the academic program until they can no
longer meet the minimum co-op requirements to graduate. Students seeking employment while attending classes must maintain a
current resume, attend seminars on employment search skills, and apply for positions. They must be easily reached and available
for interviews with prospective employers, and be proactive in the co-op search process with the assistance of the Cooperative
Education staff.
Locating positions for students with unsatisfactory academic performance can be difficult. Students who continue to remain on
academic probation and/or have been released for cause by their employer may forfeit their right to university assistance in
finding new co-op employment. These students should immediately make an appointment with their Cooperative Education
Manager/Educator.

Student Concerns and Complaints
Refer to the Academic Policies and Regulations section of this catalog, under Student Complaint Procedures.

Culminating Undergraduate Experience (Thesis) / 36

CULMINATING UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE (THESIS)
All Kettering University baccalaureate programs require completion of the Culminating Undergraduate Experience (CUE), also
known as the senior thesis, to graduate. The senior thesis is a professional document describing a comprehensive project
performed by the student. The project is generally performed for the student’s co-op employer (Co-op Thesis); however, with
employer permission the student is eligible to perform another option for his/her CUE: Entre/Intra/Social E-ship Thesis,
Research Thesis, or Professional Practice Thesis. Students become eligible to conduct work on the CUE when they have earned a
minimum of 88 credit hours (Senior I Standing). The CUE project is an academic requirement approximately taking two terms to
complete. Students are introduced to the CUE in a required seven week CUE 495 Introductory Course that will be launched in
the Fall 2014 term. There are 4 credit hours awarded for the CUE and the student will earn a grade of Pass with Distinction, Pass
or Fail upon the Faculty Thesis Advisor’s approval of Kettering’s standardized written thesis document. The focus of this project
may be a product, system, creation of a comprehensive business plan or results of investigation of a new idea.
CUE Options
A student is eligible to pursue one of four CUE options: Co-op Thesis, Research Thesis, Professional Practice Thesis and E-ship
Thesis.
Co-op Thesis
This CUE option is carried out at the student’s co-op employment. It is an individual project providing an
opportunity for the senior student to apply his or her academic and co-op experience to a realistic problem. This option
requires that a student be advised by a faculty member and employer supervisor. The student and employer advisor
together develop the project. The topic selected is to be submitted to Kettering for approval, specifically the faculty
member accepting the topic. The role of the employer advisor is to provide company resources, expertise to the student
and reviews the preliminary thesis document. For further details, an employer advisor manual is available on the CUE
website. The faculty advisor mentors the student, reviews the preliminary and final thesis documents, and issues a
grade for the thesis upon completion. The student is required to produce a tangible artifact including a comprehensive
final written report. This is a two-term project. In addition, participation in an annual Kettering Poster Session and/or
presentation of the thesis is highly encouraged.
Research Thesis
This CUE option requires the student to apply and be accepted through the Center for Culminating Undergraduate
Experiences (CCUE) in collaboration with the research faculty member. This option requires that a student be advised
by a faculty member as well as at least one qualified committee member. The topic is determined by a Kettering faculty
member for accepted students pursuing this option and requires topic approval from the Research Thesis Proposal
Review Committee. The student is required to produce a tangible artifact including a comprehensive final written
report. This is a two-term project. In addition, participation in an annual Kettering Poster Session and/or presentation
of the thesis is highly encouraged.
Professional Practice Thesis
This CUE option requires the student to apply and be accepted through the Center for Culminating Undergraduate
Experiences (CCUE). The project is focused on professional practice in a group setting and is interdisciplinary,
providing an opportunity for the senior student to apply his or her academic and co-op experience to a realistic problem
at a pre-selected organization. This option requires that a student be advised by a faculty member as well as at least
one committee member (normally company liaison). The topic is pre-selected for accepted students pursuing this
option and requires topic approval from the Professional Practice Thesis Proposal Review Committee. The student is
required to produce a tangible artifact including a comprehensive final written report. This is a two-term project. In
addition, participation in an annual Kettering Poster Session and/or presentation of the thesis is highly encouraged.
E-ship Thesis

Culminating Undergraduate Experience (Thesis) / 37

Finding a CUE/Thesis Topic
Co-op Thesis:
A topic idea for the project is submitted by the student with validation of approval from the Employer Thesis Advisor and
review/approval by a Kettering University Faculty Thesis Advisor. Upon approval, the student may begin work on the project.
The role of the Employer Advisor is to provide company resources, expertise to the student and reviews the preliminary thesis
document. For further details, an Employer Thesis Advisor Manual is available on the CUE website. The Faculty Thesis Advisor
mentors the student, reviews the preliminary and final thesis documents, and issues a grade for the thesis upon completion.
Non Co-op Thesis:
It is the student’s responsibility to find a topic for his/her thesis project. If the student is unable to secure a thesis project through
his/her Co-op Employer, the student can then look into one of the following options:
E-ship Thesis:
This is a student generated idea whereby the fundamental basis of the thesis is a value proposition that goes beyond the
design/build/technology of what may -- or may not be – a new idea, gadget, solution or improvement (“a better
mousetrap”). As such, the E-ship proposal contains criteria for consideration of the possible markets (customers),
needs, approach, benefits, and competition. The student is required to submit the topic for approval and the proposal is
available on CCUE’s website at http://www.kettering.edu/academics/academic-resources/academic-thesis-supportcenter/student. Upon review and approval from the E-ship Thesis Proposal Review Committee, the student will be
registered for the thesis project. Students are encouraged to find a Faculty Thesis Advisor to advise over the course of
the thesis; however, one will be appointed if needed. For more information, please contact:
Michelle Gebhardt, CCUE Support Center Specialist, Center for Culminating Undergraduate Experiences
3-301 AB, 810.762.9683 mgebhard@kettering.edu
Research Thesis:
This is a project focused on conducting research most often on campus due to laboratory usage. It is an opportunity for
the senior student to apply his/her academic and co-op experience to the investigation and experimentation of new
ideas. The topic is provided by a Kettering faculty member. The Kettering faculty member is required to submit the
topic for approval and the proposal is available on CCUE’s website at http://www.kettering.edu/academics/academicresources/academic-thesis-support-center/student. Upon review and approval from the Research Thesis Proposal
Review Committee, the student will be registered for the thesis project. These projects are provided by the student’s
degree department. The projects are limited and students are selected based on their expertise matching the project
scope. For more information contact your degree department head or appointed Thesis Administrator as indicated by

information is available on CCUE’s website at http://www.kettering.edu/academics/academic-resources/academicthesis-support-center/student. Projects are limited and students are selected based on their major and expertise
matching the project scope. For more information contact:
Dr. Matthew Sanders, Director, Center for Culminating Undergraduate Experiences
3-301 AB, 810.762.7946 msanders@kettering.edu
PLEASE NOTE: Students, who have not found a thesis topic by the end of their Senior I Academic Term, are to contact
Michelle Gebhardt at mgebhard@kettering.edu. These students will be scheduled to meet with the CCUE Directed Thesis
Committee and assigned a Directed Thesis project.
CUE Process
Students will be educated on the entire CUE/Thesis during Module 1: CUE Introductory Course. Students will have two advisors
upon topic approval through completion that will serve as mentors and review the comprehensive professional document. The
thesis will be archived in the Thesis Digital Archive on Kettering’s Library website for viewing. Both the student and employer
with receive a bound copy of the thesis within two months upon completion. All confidential theses will not be bound nor will be
available for viewing in the Digital Thesis Archive. Kettering’s Confidential Agreement is available in KqUest for the student’s
employer to determine the sequestering period and for signature.

Students are REQUIRED to complete four modules for his/her CUE/Thesis which include:
Module I: CUE Introductory Course - CUE 495 (Junior I or Junior II term)
Module II: Submit a Proposal for Topic Approval (no later than Junior II term)
Module III: Submit Progress Report (no later than Senior II term)
Module IV: Submit Written Thesis (1st week of Expected Graduation Term)
Registration
While the CUE project is designed to be completed within two terms, there is only one registration. In most cases, the
registration is placed in the academic term nearest to the approval of the student’s thesis topic. Upon completion of the CUE
project, when a final, passing grade is received in the Office of the Registrar and posted to the student’s record, they will receive
four credit hours for the project.
The CUE project will be considered “in progress” until a final grade is received in the Office of the Registrar and posted to the
student’s record, or until the expected term of graduation passes, whichever comes first. If the project is not completed by the
expected term of graduation, a grade of “I” (Incomplete) will be issued by the Office of the Registrar and will remain for two
terms. If the final grade is not received within those two terms, the “I” grade will convert to a grade of “F” (Fail). To extend the
incomplete, the student must contact the Center for Culminating Undergraduate Experiences for advisement and approval.

Student Records / 39

STUDENT RECORDS
The Office of the Registrar maintains the students’ permanent academic record, including course registrations, enrollment status
and the official transcript. The Registrar’s Office is the point of contact for any required enrollment and degree certifications. As
such, it is important that students keep the office current with their permanent mailing address so these services can be provided.
Note: The Registrar’s office will not discuss the student record with any third party without a written consent from the student.

Address, Phone, and Name Changes
Changes in addresses or phone numbers should be made by the student through Banner Web. Changes in addresses and phone
numbers can also be made in the Registrar’s Office, Room 3-309 AB.
In order to process a name change, a copy of a government issued photo ID such as a driver’s license and either a marriage
license, a Social Security card, or a court order that reflects the new name are necessary. Name changes must be processed
through the Registrar’s Office.

Permanent Academic Records
All information, applications, correspondence, etc., involved in admitting and processing the active progress of an admitted
student are maintained for five years after the student has last been an active degree-seeking student. After five years only the
student’s attendance dates, academic performance, corporate affiliate and degree awarded are kept as a permanent record.

Transcripts
A student's official academic record is maintained by the Registrar’s Office at Kettering University and is normally reflected
through a transcript. All requests for transcripts must be in writing. The Registrar’s Office will accept this written permission in
person, by fax 810-762-9836, scan/email, or by US mail. There is no charge for transcripts. Official transcripts will not be issued
to students who fail to meet their financial obligations or agreements with Kettering University. Unofficial transcripts are also
available on Banner Web.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) / 40

THE FAMILY EDUCATIONAL RIGHTS AND PRIVACY ACT (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (commonly referred to as “FERPA” or the “Buckley Amendment”), helps
protect the privacy of student records. The Act provides for the right to inspect and review education records, the right to seek to
amend those records and to limit disclosure of information from the records. The Act applies to all institutions that are the
recipients of federal funding.
In accordance with FERPA, Kettering University has policies and procedures in place to protect the privacy of education records.
Students will be notified of their FERPA rights annually by publication in the Undergraduate and Graduate Catalogs and by an
annual email message to students at the beginning of the academic year.
Disclosure of Education Records
Kettering University will disclose information from a student's education record only with the written consent of the student,
except:
1.

To school officials who have a legitimate educational interest in the records.
A school official is:
•
A person employed by the university in an administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff
position (including Campus Safety and Wellness Center staff);
•
A person elected to the Board of Trustees;
•
A student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another
school official in performing his or her task;
•
A volunteer or person employed by or under contract to the university to perform a special task, such as legal
counsel or an auditor;
•
Agencies conducting business on behalf of Kettering University (i.e. National Student Clearinghouse, officials of the
U.S. Department of Education and state and local educational authorities, accrediting organizations and banks).
Educational Need to Know:
A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to
fulfill his or her professional responsibilities for Kettering University.

2.
3.
4.
5.
6.
7.

To officials of another school, upon request, in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
In connection with a student's request for or receipt of financial aid, as necessary to determine the eligibility, amount, or
conditions of the financial aid, or to enforce the terms and conditions of the aid.
To organizations conducting certain studies for or on behalf of the university.
To comply with a judicial order or a lawfully issued subpoena.
To appropriate parties in a health or safety emergency.
When the request is for directory information (see below).

Solomon Amendment
Federal law requires that all institutions of higher learning provide directory information to the military upon request,
including student name, address, telephone number, age or year of birth, academic major and level of education (e.g.
freshman, sophomore, etc. or degree awarded). Where there is a conflict between the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act of 1974 (FERPA), the Solomon Amendment would supersede FERPA.

Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) / 41

Annual Notification to Students of Rights Under the Family Educational
Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records.
They include:
(1) Inspect and Review of Records
The right to inspect and review the student's education records within 45 days after the day the University receives a request for
access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written
request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and
notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University
official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should
be addressed.
(2) Amendment of Records
The right to request the amendment of the student's education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or
otherwise violate the student's privacy rights under FERPA. Students should write the University official responsible for the
record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it should be changed. If the University decides
not to amend the record as requested, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or her
right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided
to the student when notified of the right to a hearing.
(3) Consent to Disclosure
The right to provide written consent before the university discloses personally identifiable information from the student's
education records, except to the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent.
The school discloses education records without a student’s prior written consent under the FERPA exception for disclosure to
school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by Kettering University in an
administrative, supervisory, academic, research, or support staff position (including Campus Safety and Wellness Center staff); a
person serving on the board of trustees; a student serving on an official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee,
or assisting another school official in performing his or her task; a volunteer or person employed by or under contract to the
university to perform a special task, such as legal counsel or an auditor; agencies conducting business on behalf of Kettering
University (i.e. National Student Clearinghouse, accrediting organizations and banks).
A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or
her professional responsibilities for Kettering University.
(4) FERPA Complaints
The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Kettering University to
comply with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the Office that administers FERPA is:

Academic Policies and Regulations / 42

ACADEMIC POLICIES AND REGULATIONS
All faculty and students are urged to review and understand the University’s Academic Policies and Regulations. This section is
intended as a convenient reference for faculty, staff and students. It also serves as a description of the student's academic rights
and responsibilities and as a guarantee of equitable treatment for all students. Some sections may reference other sections of the
catalog, when necessary. Each section also concludes with the name of the official or office to contact with questions.

Academic Advising
The primary purpose of the Kettering University academic advising program is to support the university’s mission of preparing
future leaders for a global workplace by assisting students in the development of meaningful educational plans. At Kettering,
academic advising represents a shared relationship between the student and his/her academic advisor and a process of continuous
improvement, clarification and evaluation with the aim of assisting the student in achieving his/her goals. Each academic
department has established its own system for facilitating advising processes as well as a representative academic program. In
addition to following the representative program, students are encouraged to meet regularly with an academic advisor (at least
once per academic term) to discuss academic matters, to determine progress toward degree completion, and to ensure that
prerequisites have been satisfied and other departmental requirements have been met.
Questions: Contact the degree/program department

Academic Standing
Kettering University has four levels of academic standing: good standing, academic warning, academic probation, and academic
review. The four levels are discussed in detail below.
Good Standing
To be in good academic standing, a student must maintain a term and cumulative GPA (grade point average) of at least 2.0.
Academic Warning
A student who fails to meet the criterion for good standing is placed on academic warning.
•
If at the end of the warning term both GPAs (term and cumulative) are at least 2.0, the student returns to good standing.
•
If at the end of the warning term either the term or the cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, the student is held on academic
warning for one more term.
•
If at the end of the warning term both GPAs (term and cumulative) are below 2.0, the student is placed on academic
probation. A student who has been on warning for two terms and has not returned to good standing will also be placed
on academic probation.
Academic Probation
A student is placed on academic probation after two consecutive terms in which he or she fails to earn both a term and
cumulative GPA of at least 2.0.
•
If at the end of the probation term both GPAs (term and cumulative) are at least 2.0, the student returns to good
standing.
•
If at the end of the probation term, either the term or the cumulative GPA falls below 2.0, the student is held on
academic probation for one more term.
•
If at the end of the probation term both GPAs (term and cumulative) are below 2.0, the student’s case is reviewed by
the Academic Review Committee (ARC) for potential dismissal. A student who has been held on probation for two
terms and has not returned to good standing will also be reviewed by ARC.
A student on academic probation is required to develop and implement strategies for academic success with the assistance of a
success coach. Appointments for success coaching may be arranged by visiting the Academic Success Center (3-322, Academic
Building), emailing academicsuccess@kettering.edu, or calling (810) 762-9775. Students on probation cannot register for
consecutive academic terms.
Academic Review
Students on probation that fail to show significant academic improvement are referred to the Academic Review Committee, a
subcommittee of the Kettering University’s Faculty Senate. Students referred for academic review have two options withdrawing from the university or appealing to the Academic Review Committee.

Academic Policies and Regulations / 43

Withdrawal
Students who choose to withdraw must submit a completed Undergraduate Withdrawal from University Form to the
Academic Success Center no later than the end of week five of the term.
Appeal
Students who choose to appeal to the Academic Review Committee, must submit an appeal letter along with any
relevant supporting documents to the Academic Success Center no later than the end of week five of the term.
Guidelines for submitting an appeal can be found on the ASC’s website http://www.kettering.edu/academics/academic-resources/academic-success-center/advising/probation. The decision of
that committee is final, and no further appeal process is available.
Readmission
Whether the students withdraw or are dismissed from the university, they may be readmitted to Kettering under specific
conditions. Students granted readmission will be admitted on a probation status and will be required to meet with an adviser to
design an academic improvement plan (AIP). Students are expected to meet all the requirements of the AIP. Students cannot
register for consecutive academic terms immediately following the readmission. If students lose good academic standing after
readmission, they will proceed directly to the academic review process. Students are allowed only one readmission following an
academic review.
Readmission after withdrawal
Students that decide to return to Kettering after a voluntary academic review withdrawal can do so after three
consecutive terms (nine months) and with the signed approval of the Academic Success Center. Students requesting
readmission after a withdrawal must submit a letter to the Academic Success Center no later than the end of week five
of the term prior to being readmitted.
Readmission after dismissal
Students who are dismissed by the Academic Review Committee must petition for readmission directly to the
committee no later than the end of week five of the term prior to being readmitted. All students can apply for
readmission after a minimum of three terms (nine months) following the term of academic dismissal and only if all of
the following conditions are met:
•
During the period of dismissal the student attended another institution of higher education as a full-time, nondegree- seeking student, completing a minimum of twelve credit hours per term/semester.
•
The student earned a 3.0 term/semester GPA from the college of attendance.
•
Courses taken were representative of courses taken within the student’s chosen degree program at Kettering
University.
To request readmission after a dismissal, students must submit a letter along with the official transcript from the
institution in which the courses were taken to the Academic Review Committee (c/o Academic Success Center).
Juniors and seniors can apply for provisional readmission after a minimum of two terms (six months) following the
term of academic dismissal. To request provisional readmission, students must meet with an advisor in the Academic
Success Center. In order for students to be fully readmitted, students must achieve a term GPA ≥ 3.0 during the
provisional term with no individual course grade below a C. All withdrawals and incompletes during the provisional
term must be pre-approved by the Academic Success Center.
Academic Support
The Academic Success Center provides a wide range of academic support to Kettering University students. Peer tutors assist
students with subject knowledge in undergraduate math and science courses. Writing consultants help students with writing
assignments in any classes. Professional advisors offer advising and coaching services. Appointments are preferred but not
necessary. Tutoring schedules are available online (www.kettering.edu/AcademicSuccessCenter) and in the Academic Success
Center (3-322 AB). For more information, call (810) 762-9775.

Academic and Work Terms
Students alternate 11 week academic terms with 12 week terms of progressively challenging work with an authorized employer.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Academic Policies and Regulations / 44

The Alternation Sequence – Academic and Work Terms
Each student assumes responsibility for maintaining satisfactory progress toward their degree. This includes following an
alternating sequence between school and work while they are enrolled (two school terms and two work terms per academic year).
This alternation schedule is determined based on the student’s section status (A or B section) noted below.
A-Section
Summer: School
Fall:
Work
Winter: School
Spring: Work

B-Section
Summer: Work
Fall:
School
Winter: Work
Spring: School

Any changes to this school/work sequence must be approved in advance through the petition process (below).
Petition to Alter Academic/Work Sequence
If circumstances arise and a student finds it necessary to alter their academic/work sequence, they must submit a Petition to Alter
Academic/Work Sequence Form. Exceptions are considered for circumstances involving GPA issues, problems in course
scheduling, change in academic major, employment status, special academic opportunities (such as study abroad programs) or a
documented, major medical concern. Students may not adjust their alternation sequence without receiving advisement and all
required approvals on the petition form. This ensures the student, their academic advisor, the employer, the Cooperative
Education Manager/Educator and the Office of the Registrar will be aware of any change in plans. As such, arrangements made
between students and employers may or may not be approved. It is the responsibility of the student to submit the completed,
signed Petition to the Office of the Registrar so that appropriate registration adjustments are made. Failure to comply with this
procedure may put the student’s status with the university in jeopardy and, in some cases, the student being dropped from the coop program. Students should consult with the Financial Aid Office for information on how altering the academic/work sequence
may affect financial aid.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Attendance
Prompt and regular attendance is expected of the student for all scheduled course and laboratory work. Student participation in
class discussion, question/answer sessions and problem solving is critical to the expected student learning outcome. Faculty may
include explicit attendance requirements with course grade penalties in their course. The student is expected to clearly
understand, at the beginning of the term, if such requirements exist. Students should note that, although professors are not
required to provide opportunity for making up missed work due to absence, most professors provide that opportunity when the
absence was beyond the student’s control. Only the professor may or may not excuse an absence.
Dismissal for Violation of Professor’s Attendance:
Faculty may have strict attendance policies whereby a student is dismissed from a class when a set number of absences are
accumulated. If the dismissal occurs during the course withdrawal period specified on the academic calendar, a grade of W
(withdrawn) is issued. If the dismissal occurs after the specified course withdrawal period, the grade of F (fail) is issued. The
student may appeal the dismissal to the department head.
Last Known Date of Attendance Reporting:
Kettering University does not require faculty to take attendance. However, the U.S. Department of Education requires the
Financial Aid Office to differentiate students who fail a class because they quit attending from those who fail a class based on
merit. Because a student could be a financial aid applicant at any point during the academic year, we must collect this
information for all students, so that financial aid eligibility can be accurately determined.
The Last Known Date of Attendance Reporting Policy is necessary to appropriately assess the financial liability for students,
ensure good stewardship of financial aid funds, and limit the financial liability for the university and academic consequences for
the student. The amount of Title IV funds earned by a student is based on the amount of time spent in attendance by the student
for that term. In addition, this is often useful in arbitrating cases when students believe they completed the process to drop or
withdraw from a course.
After the drop/add period each term, a “last date of attendance” notification, or “never attended” notification by a faculty member
will result in the automatic assignment of either a WN (withdrawal for non-attendance) grade or an FN (failure for nonattendance) grade by the Registrar’s Office. This will initiate re-evaluation of a student's financial aid and Federal Title IV aid
will be adjusted for those classes.

Academic Policies and Regulations / 45

Student Responsibility
Students are expected to regularly attend classes in which they are enrolled. Students who decide to stop attending
courses should immediately withdraw from those course(s) prior to the course withdrawal deadline specified on the
academic calendar. Students who do not officially withdraw from a course (or courses) they are not attending may be
reported by their instructor as having a last date of attendance. When this happens, the student will remain responsible
for any financial liability, less applicable refunds they have incurred associated with the last date of attendance
reported, and for any academic consequences associated with the last date of attendance reported and the assignment of
the WN or FN grade.
School Responsibility
After the drop/add period each term, a last date of attendance reporting by a faculty member will result in the automatic
assignment of either a grade of WN (withdrawal for non-attendance) or FN (failure for non-attendance) by the
Registrar’s Office as follows:
•
A grade of WN (withdrawal for non-attendance) will be issued if the last known date of attendance is within
the course withdrawal period specified on the academic calendar. A WN grade is treated the same as a W
(withdrawal) grade in that it will not affect a student’s term or overall GPA.
•
A grade of FN (failure for non-attendance) will be issued if the last known date of attendance is after the
course withdrawal period specified on the academic calendar. An FN grade is treated the same as a failing
grade in that it will be included in a students’ term and overall GPA.
•
Once a faculty member has reported a last date of attendance, the student will no longer be able to attend or
participate in the class.
With the Last Known Date of Attendance Reporting Policy, the assumption is that students who receive an F in a class
have received that grade based on merit, and not because they quit attending.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Auditing a Course
Occasionally, a student may wish to attend a course without earning credit (for example, to refresh course knowledge). This
arrangement is called “auditing” a course. Audited courses are listed on the students’ official transcript with the grade AU (audit)
and no credits earned.
A student needs the course instructor’s permission to audit a course. Students who want to audit a course must complete a
Request to Audit Course Form, have it signed by the course instructor, and submit it to the Office of the Registrar by the end of
the drop/add period specified on the academic calendar. Audits cannot be changed to a regular enrollment after the drop/add
period noted on the academic calendar. Audited courses do not count toward completing program or degree requirements.
Students who choose an audit option are expected to attend the audited class and complete all course requirements (with the
exclusion of the tests). If the students do not meet attendance requirements for the course, they earn the grade of WN (withdrawn
for non-attendance). Once a WN grade is issued, the student may no longer attend or participate in the class. AU and WN grades
do not affect the term and cumulative grade point averages.
Audited courses incur regular tuition fees; however, audits are not considered part of a course load for academic or financial aid
purposes, which means that students cannot count audited credits toward a full-time student status, or receive financial aid for an
audited class.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Bachelor/Master Program
These options are available only to Kettering University undergraduate students entering the MBA, Operations Management,
Engineering or Engineering Management graduate programs.
Kettering University undergraduate students who desire to obtain a master’s degree may elect to complete the Bachelor/Master
Program which provides students an opportunity to accelerate the process in which they earn both a bachelor’s degree and a
master’s degree. This program is only available to Kettering University undergraduate students and leverages Kettering
University’s premier academic programs. Students who are admitted into the Bachelor/Master Program will complete the same
total number of work terms as conventional non-Bachelor/Master undergraduate students.

Academic Policies and Regulations / 46

Option 1: Undergraduate (BBA/BS) Thesis
•
•
•
•

Students must apply before graduating (after completing 120 credit hours) or within six (6) years after obtaining their
undergraduate degree.
The student completes the undergraduate degree, with the traditional undergraduate thesis (BS), and receives
the bachelor’s degree at the conventional time.
Up to eight (8) credits of mezzanine level (500-level) courses, which were completed at the undergraduate
level, are also applied to the master’s degree. (Mechanical Engineering capstone courses do not apply.)
Forty (40) credits remain to complete the MBA (total of 48 graduate credits) or thirty-two (32) credits remain
to complete the master of science degree (total of 40 graduate credits). As an option, four (4) of these credits
can be granted for an MS thesis.

Concentrations
A concentration is a specialized area of study within a major area of study. A concentration requires a minimum of two classes
(eight credits) in a directed area of study. Concentrations appear on a student’s transcript at student declaration, and requirements
must be completed at the time of graduation. A concentration is not required for all majors for graduation.
A student wishing to declare a concentration should consult the head of the department that houses the major area of study, or a
faculty advisor in that department. The department, in turn, will update the student record.

E-mail: Notification/Obligation to Read
All students have the privilege of having a Kettering University Google Apps e-mail account. The Kettering e-mail account is
one of the official ways Kettering University faculty and staff communicate to students. Students are responsible for required
actions conveyed to them through this communication vehicle, whether or not they read the message. Kettering provides each
student with 25GB of e-mail server storage. Therefore, we strongly recommend that students do not auto forward to another email service provider which may have less storage capacity, fewer features, and may hinder you to reply directly to the original
email source. Due to the proliferation of spam and phishing emails, be advised that you may receive emails that may request
personal information such as usernames and passwords. Although it may look authentic, pretending to originate from a legitimate
source such as Kettering, do not respond. Immediately delete it recognizing that a legitimate source such as the Kettering IT
department would never ask you to provide information such as passwords. Be cautious regarding any unsolicited email as it may
contain elements that would prove to be detrimental to your computer.
Questions: Contact Information Technology

Enrollment Status/Verifications
Enrollment verifications for medical insurance, loan deferments, employment or other needs may be obtained through the Office
of the Registrar. Enrollment verifications confirm a student's enrollment status (full-time, three-quarter time, half-time and less
than half-time) and expected graduation date. Listed below are the enrollment statuses at Kettering University:
15 or more credits or COOP or Culminating Undergraduate Experience (thesis) = Full Time
12-14 credits = Three Quarter Time
8-11 credits = Half Time
1-7 credits or THS3 = Less Than Half Time
Inactive Status Due to Non-enrollment
Students must have a registration in each term for course work, coop, or the culminating undergraduate experience (CUE) in
order to remain a student in an active status. Circumstances may occur where this may not be possible. The student must then
withdraw from the Kettering degree program until the next academic term in which they could be enrolled. Refer to the
Academic Policies and Regulations section of this catalog for information on Withdrawals. Students with no registrations and
who do not formally withdraw will automatically become inactive (separated) due to non-enrollment. Inactive students may
apply for readmission by submitting an Application for Readmission Form to the Office of the Registrar, available in the Office
of the Registrar or on their website. The student’s cooperative employer is not obligated to continue their agreement with the
student if the student status becomes inactive. However, the student and the employer are encouraged to make arrangements to
re-establish that agreement when the student returns to active degree-seeking status whenever that is desirable and in their mutual
interest. Students in an inactive status will no longer have access to any campus buildings, the Recreation Center or Banner Web.
Inactive students are not eligible for participation in commencement.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Final Examinations
Kettering University policy requires each student to participate in a comprehensive final learning experience in each course. The
extent to which that experience contributes to the student's course grade may vary by professor and by course, but generally
amounts to between 20 and 40 percent.

Course Hours and Points Definitions
Quality Points = Grade x Credit Hours
GPA = Quality Points ÷ GPA Hours
Attempted hours (AHRS) - are the sum of the course credit hours for which a student has registered. Attempted hours per term
is the basis for determining tuition charges and a measure of the student load.
Credit hour - represents one sixty-minute class period per week. For laboratory courses each credit hour represents two hours of
scheduled laboratory work. A student is expected to devote three hours of effort per week for each registered credit hour. For
example, a sixteen credit-hour load would require a total of forty-eight hours a week in classes, laboratories, study, and
preparation.
Earned hours (EHRS) - represent work equivalent to that defined for a University credit hour which the student has successfully
completed at Kettering University, at another institution or by examination. Not all earned hours necessarily apply to the specific
degree program being pursued by the student.

Academic Policies and Regulations / 50

Grade Point Average (GPA) - is computed for each term individually and cumulatively. In either case, the weighted GPA is
computed by dividing the total quality points earned by the total quality hours accumulated.
GPA hours (GPA-HRS) - are equal to the credit hour value of the course and are awarded only for course work taken at
Kettering University. Only course work resulting in GPA hours is used in computing a student’s grade point average (GPA).
Quality Points (QPTS) - are a computational value used to compute a student’s grade point average (GPA). The quality points
earned for a given course are equal to the credit hour value of the course multiplied by the numerical equivalent of the letter
grade.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Grade Appeals
The course instructor has the authority and obligation to assign appropriate grades in any course. Questions concerning an
assigned final grade are to be handled through the grade appeal process. The first level of academic appeal is the professor whose
decision is questioned. The first step in this process involves contacting the course instructor in writing.
The process is initiated by completing a Grade Appeal Form. Each student must complete the grade appeal form and attach any
pertinent documentation to support his/her claim. Appeals should be initiated as soon as possible but no later than four (4)
months after the grade has been posted. The student’s failure to access grades does not provide an exemption from the time
limitation. The faculty member should respond within two (2) weeks of the student’s request for grade modification.
Students who are not satisfied with the decision of the Professor to whom they appealed, may subsequently appeal to the
instructor’s department head within 30 days of the faculty member’s response. The Department Head must respond in writing to
the student with a copy to the Instructor within 30 days of receipt of the appeal. The Department Head will serve as a mediator
between the student and the instructor but cannot change a grade.
Students may submit a final appeal to the Associate Provost and Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs for appeal board
review under the following conditions:
•
Final course grades may be appealed only if the student can demonstrate that the grading policy applied to his/her grade
does not conform with the stated grading policy of the professor. The absence of a grading policy will be considered
reasonable grounds for appeal.
•
The only legitimate grounds for second level appeal are arbitrariness, prejudice, or error, as applied to a specific
student.
•
Final appeals are restricted to cases in which the department head disagrees with the instructor’s decision.
When a final appeal is initiated, the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs will convene an appeal board comprised of
the following members: one tenured faculty member from the instructor’s department, chosen by the instructor; one tenured
faculty member from the instructor’s department, chosen by the department head; one tenured faculty member from outside the
instructor’s department, chosen by the Chair of ADEPT and the Associate Vice President for Academic Affairs (or designee),
who does not vote, but chairs the board and handles all administrative matters. If the Appeal Board chooses to override the
faculty member’s grade, they can only do so by changing the grade to a “P” for passing. The Provost’s Office will provide a
written overview of the Appeal Board’s decision to all involved parties. Appeal Board actions represent a final university
decision.
Students who are dismissed or suspended for reasons other than academic should refer to the Student Handbook for appeal
procedures.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Grade Changes
Grades (except incompletes) reported by an instructor are considered permanent and final. However, requests for a change of
grade after an instructor reports a final grade will be honored to correct an error in calculating or assigning that grade. To
facilitate this process, the instructor will submit to the Registrar a grade change form noting the rationale for the change and what
retroactive correction is to be made. This form must be countersigned by the instructor’s department head. Grade changes must
be processed within one calendar year (12 months) from the last date of the term in which the course was taken. This includes
incomplete grades that have been changed to a grade or have converted to a failing grade. Grade changes are not permitted after a
degree has been awarded.

Incomplete Grades
The grade of "I" (Incomplete) may be issued by an instructor for any course in which the instructor deems that the work has not
been completed and that it would be fair and equitable to allow the student additional time to complete the work. The conditions
and terms for completion of the course are mutually agreed upon by the instructor and the student. The deadline for completion
is at the discretion of the instructor but is not to exceed six months from the last day of the term in which the course was
registered. If a final grade is not submitted within six months, the incomplete grade converts to an “F” (Fail) on the student’s
record and will be reflected in the students’ GPA. The grade of “F” will be considered a permanent grade.
The incomplete grade may be extended by the instructor for up to an additional six months, or one calendar year from the end of
the term in which the course was registered. To initiate an extension, the instructor will notify the Office of the Registrar in
writing. The instructor is under no obligation to grant an extension. If a final grade is not submitted within the six month
extension period, the incomplete grade converts to an “F” (Fail) on the student’s record and will be reflected in the students’
GPA. The grade of “F” will be considered a permanent grade.
A written agreement must be developed between the instructor and the student to clarify a plan for completion of the course. The
student initiates this agreement by completing an Incomplete Grade Agreement Form after the incomplete grade has been issued
by the instructor. The form will be filed in the Office of the Registrar as official documentation of the agreement.
Students should note that an incomplete grade does not yet reflect credit in the course. This means if a course with an incomplete
grade is a prerequisite for another course, they may not register for the other course until the incomplete grade has been changed
to reflect a passing grade. Prerequisite overrides are granted at the discretion of the department head for the course.

Academic Policies and Regulations / 53

Independent/Directed Study
In order to increase the scope and flexibility of course offerings, many departments offer courses under the designation of
Independent or Directed Study. A student who desires a course not normally offered or not available during a given term should
approach the instructor in whose discipline the course would normally fall to discuss the possibility of an Independent or
Directed Study. If the instructor agrees, a written proposal may be required from the student, specifying the reading and/or
research to be undertaken, reports or tests to be used for grading purposes, number of meetings per week, number of credits to be
awarded, etc.
Independent Study
An independent study is a unique topic in a specific area of study not offered in an existing course. Requirements and meeting
times are arranged by the instructor and student. A student must request and receive approval for an independent study through
the instructional department. This is done by completing an Independent/Directed Study Form stating the independent study
name and description, and obtaining all required signatures. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar
no later than the last day of the drop/add period specified on the published academic calendar.
Directed Study
A directed study is a course listed in the undergraduate catalog but not scheduled during a given term. It is done on a one-on-one
basis with an instructor for that course. A student must request and receive approval for a directed study through the instructional
department. This is done by completing an Independent/Directed Study Form stating the course number and obtaining all
required signatures. The completed form must be submitted to the Office of the Registrar no later than the last day of the
drop/add period specified on the published academic calendar.
Questions: Contact the department offering the course

Leave of Absence
The Undergraduate Student Leave of Absence (LOA) Policy assists and encourages students to return and complete their
degree after up to two consecutive terms of absence from Kettering University. Eligible students are encouraged to take
advantage of the benefits provided by an LOA, e.g., no need to apply for readmission and may participate in their regularly
scheduled registration/enrollment period upon return to the University. Refer to the Leave of Absence Request Form for more
information and instructions.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Majors (Declaring/Changing)
A major is an area of concentrated study which requires a minimum of 41 classes (161 credits). A student wishing to declare,
change or add a major should consult the head of the department housing the major, or a faculty advisor within that department.
The student is then responsible for completing a Declare/Change of Degree Request Form and obtaining all required signatures.
This form must then be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for processing. The Registrar, in turn, will update the student
record and send official notification of the change to the appropriate departments.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Minors (Declaring/Removing)
A minor is an area of concentrated study outside of the major area of study. A minor requires a minimum of four classes (16
credits) in a directed area of study. Minors may require coursework beyond the minimum 161 credits required for completion of
the major. Coursework taken outside of Kettering University is not transferable towards a minor. Minors are not required for
graduation though a student may elect to pursue a minor in an area of additional interest. Minors appear on a student’s transcript
at student declaration, and requirements must be completed at the time of graduation. The Academic Department granting the
minor provides an audit for each student who applies to graduate. Refer to the “Minors” section of this catalog for a complete list
of minors and their requirements.
A student wishing to declare a minor should consult the head of the department that houses the minor, or a faculty advisor in that
department. The student is then responsible for completing a Minor Declare/Change Request Form (this form is necessary to
declare or remove a minor). This form must then be submitted to the Office of the Registrar for processing. The Registrar, in
turn, will update the student record.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Academic Policies and Regulations / 54

Proficiency Credit by Examination
Students may petition the Department Head responsible for a given course to receive earned hours by examination for that
course. If the department head deems it appropriate and acceptable, the student will be given the means to demonstrate
knowledge and performance of the course material at a level no less than an average student enrolled in the course. If such
demonstration is successful, the course credit hours will be awarded to the student as earned hours by examination and will be
indicated on the student’s transcript. A student who previously attempted a course or is currently enrolled in a course may not
use the proficiency credit by examination option for that course. Students may attempt to earn credit by proficiency in a specific
course only once, regardless of whether the examination is passed or failed.
Questions: Contact the degree/program department head for the course

Readmission to Kettering University
Students who were academically eligible to continue when they became inactive or withdrew may return to active status by
completing an Application for Readmission. The Registrar will inform the student of the registration steps and assist in obtaining
the necessary classes. The student will also need to be in good financial standing to be reinstated. Students are allowed to
reactivate their active student status without having an official cooperative employer for one term only. Permission to continue
after that one term is determined on a case-by-case basis and is for one additional term at a time.
Questions: Contact the Office of the Registrar

Registration
New Students
All first-time freshmen are given exams in mathematics unless college transfer credit or Advanced Placement credit is awarded
for calculus. Based on exam results and intended degree program, each student will be registered for first term courses and will
receive their schedules during orientation weekend.
First-term transfer students are scheduled based upon the individual's choice of major and the amount of transferable course work
awarded. The student will be given an opportunity to review transfer credits and term class schedule during the transfer student
orientation held prior to the start of classes.
Continuing Students
Registration takes place each term during eighth, ninth, tenth and eleventh weeks. Students register for the next academic term;
i.e., register in spring term for fall classes, register in summer term for winter classes, etc. Financial clearance from the Student
Accounts Office and a completed course selection form, if required, signed by both student and faculty advisor are required to
participate in registration. Future schedules will be administratively adjusted if prerequisite courses are not satisfactorily
completed.
Students may receive academic advising and course selection approval by making an appointment with their faculty advisor.
Seniors, juniors, sophomores and freshmen with a declared major receive advisement in their degree department. Students who
have not declared a major receive advisement in the Academic Success Center.
A students’ registration time period is based upon their current class standing and does not count current registrations or class
rank. Each class standing will have a 24 hour window of opportunity to register for classes before the next standing will be
allowed to register.
Course Registration with Co-op or Thesis
All students are automatically registered in their cooperative work experience and thesis terms. Students are allowed to register
for a maximum of eight credits of coursework while registered for a co-op or thesis term. Complete the Course Selection During
Co-op Term Form to initiate the process.
Course Loads
The representative program of courses shown term-by-term for each of the degrees offered indicate what is considered a normal
course load. In general, those loads are four courses per term for underclassmen amounting to approximately 16 attempted hours,
and five per term for upperclassmen, amounting to 20 attempted hours. Refer to the Tuition and Fees section of this catalog for
tuition rates/credit hours.

Academic Policies and Regulations / 55

Drop/Add
Students may drop and add courses during the late registration and drop/add period noted on the published academic calendar.
Any student who does not appear on the final roster by the conclusion of the late registration and drop/add period will not receive
credit for the course.
Late Registration
Students may “late register” (after the registration period) by contacting the Office of the Registrar. The deadline to late register
is by the end of the late registration and drop/add period noted on the published academic calendar. Any student who does not
appear on the final roster by the conclusion of the late registration and drop/add period will not receive credit for the course.
Overloads
Students are eligible to register for one additional course beyond the limits if:
•
Their cumulative GPA is 3.5 or higher, and
•
They have completed a minimum of 16 credit hours with no course withdrawals or failures in both the current term and
previous academic term, and
•
They are not currently enrolled in college mathematics.
Students wishing to take overloads beyond the standards above will need to obtain approval from the Registrar by completing a
Request for Overload Form. Only students in good academic standing are allowed to attempt an overload. Students whose
performance is less-than-good standing may be required to take a course load less than that represented for their degree program.
These students should contact Academic Services (Room 3-322 AB) with questions and for advisement.
Undergraduates Taking Graduate Courses
Students taking 500 or above level courses are not automatically admissible to the graduate program. They still have to meet all
published admissions requirements. NOTE: Courses taken for undergraduate credit at Kettering University may not be repeated
at the graduate level and count towards the graduate program. Furthermore, 500-level courses taken at Kettering University for
undergraduate credit may not count as graduate credit except as approved per the BS/MS and BS/MBA policy guidelines.
Undergraduates Taking Graduate Courses for Undergraduate Credit
Students enrolled in an undergraduate degree program at Kettering University may request registration in a Kettering
graduate level course (above 500-level) for undergraduate credit. To do this, students must:
•
Complete and receive instructional department and degree department approvals on the Undergraduate
Request to take Graduate Course Form AND submit form to Registrar’s Office for proper registration.
Undergraduates Taking Graduate Courses for Graduate Credit

Student Complaint Procedures
A complaint is a written or verbal expression of dissatisfaction or formal allegation against the university, its units, its employees
(including faculty and staff), and/or its students.
Harassment and Discrimination
For complaints related to harassment or discrimination in the learning or work environment, refer to the Student Life section of
this catalog, under Student Conduct: Behavioral Standards.
Other Complaints
Currently enrolled students who have a complaint or issue should first try to work out the problem informally by discussing it in
an honest and constructive manner with those persons most involved with the issue. Many complaints can be resolved when a
student makes an effort to honestly communicate his/her frustrations or concerns. If a student has a complaint related to a
specific course he or she is enrolled in, he/she should first consult with the instructor of the course. If necessary, the student or
instructor may consult with the academic department head responsible for the course for guidance on how to best resolve the
student’s concern.
For any complaints that the student cannot resolve informally with the parties involved, the student should contact either the
Dean of Student (for non-academic-related issues) or the Associate Provost for Academic Affairs (for academic-related issues).

Withdrawals
Course Withdrawal
When circumstances occur whereby a student feels that completion of a course is not possible or in the student’s interest, the
student may request a non-punitive grade of W (withdrawn) be issued by the Registrar’s Office. The following conditions apply:
• Withdrawal requests will be accepted and honored during the course withdrawal period specified on the academic
calendar. After that period, the student may not withdraw from the course and is committed to receiving a Kettering
letter grade, which may include a grade of FN (failure for non-attendance).
• Students must complete a Course Withdrawal Request Form, have it signed by the course instructor (and advisor if the
student is a freshmen or sophomore), and submit it to the Registrar’s Office for processing by the deadline for course
withdrawals specified on the academic calendar.
• Withdrawals are included in the number of repeat attempts.
• Refer to the Tuition and Financial Aid sections of this catalog for the refund rate schedule and how withdrawing from a
course may impact financial aid.
Term Withdrawal
Withdrawing from the term requires a completed Undergraduate Withdrawal from University Form available in the Office of the
Registrar or on their website. Complete instructions and information are included on the form.
University Withdrawal
Withdrawing from the University requires a completed Undergraduate Withdrawal from University Form available in the Office
of the Registrar or on their website. Complete instructions and information are included on the form.
Withdrawal due to Military Call to Active Duty
Students may withdraw from the University and receive a 100% tuition refund upon presenting to the Registrar, the original
Armed Forces orders. Non-punitive grades of W will be issued. Should the call come during eighth week or later, in the judgment

Academic Policies and Regulations / 59

of the instructor and the student, incompletes may be given with no reimbursement of tuition. Course work then would be
completed per arrangements agreed upon by the instructor and student.
Withdrawal – Medical/Compassionate (After 7th Friday)
A medical/compassionate withdrawal request may be made in extraordinary cases in which serious illness or injury (medical) or
another significant personal situation (compassionate) prevents a student from continuing his or her classes or withdrawing
during the course withdrawal period specified on the academic calendar, and incompletes or other arrangements with the
instructors are not possible.
Usually, consideration is for a complete withdrawal. All applications for withdrawal require thorough and credible
documentation; however, applications for less than a complete withdrawal must be especially well documented to justify the
selective nature of the partial medical/compassionate withdrawal.
A student may request and be considered for a medical withdrawal when extraordinary circumstances, such as a serious illness
or injury prevent the student from continuing classes. The medical withdrawal policy covers both physical and mental health
difficulties.
A student may request and be considered for a compassionate withdrawal when extraordinary personal reasons, not related to
the student's personal physical or mental health (for example, a death in the student's immediate family, care of a seriously ill
family member, etc.), prevent the student from continuing in classes.
All requests for medical and compassionate withdrawals must be made through the Wellness Center and require approval by the
Vice President for Student Life and Dean of Students. When requesting either of these withdrawals, students must provide:
•

A written statement summarizing the circumstances and providing detailed information regarding the reason for the
request. If the reason for the withdrawal began or took place during the course withdrawal period specified on the
academic calendar, students must provide an explanation for not withdrawing by the published deadline.

•

Medical withdrawal requests must include supporting documentation from a licensed health care professional detailing
the date of onset, dates of treatment, the general nature of your condition and how and why it prevented you from
completing your course work, and the last date you were able to attend class. This documentation must be on official
letterhead and must be specific to this request. Prescriptions and similar types of documentation will not be sufficient.

•

Compassionate withdrawal requests must be accompanied by documentation pertinent to the precipitating event. For
example, a compassionate withdrawal request to care for a seriously ill family member may require information similar
to that for a medical withdrawal. Other required documentation may include police reports, legal documents, airline
ticket receipts, newspaper clippings, etc.

Students considering requesting medical or compassionate withdrawals after the course withdrawal period specified on the
academic calendar should consult with the Wellness Center as soon as possible. No refunds apply to medical or compassionate
withdrawals which take place after the course withdrawal deadline.

request personal information such as usernames and passwords. Although it may look authentic, pretending to originate from a
legitimate source such as Kettering, do not respond. Immediately delete it recognizing that a legitimate source such as the
Kettering IT department would never ask you to provide information such as passwords. Be cautious regarding any unsolicited
email as it may contain elements that would prove to be detrimental to your computer.

have degree department approval.
Course Work
The course work taken through a Kettering University Study-Abroad Program is fully applicable toward credits in the student’s
degree program for up to 20 credit hours. Students may receive this maximum only if 4 credits are earned from passing a foreign
language course. The study-abroad curriculum also requires participants to register for a 4 credit Advanced Social Science
elective as one of the five classes taken abroad, whenever an approved class is offered by the partner institution.
Course Credit for Laboratory Courses Taken at German Partner Universities:
Students enrolled in our German partner universities receive a grade of P or F for laboratory courses. In the German system, a P
grade is equivalent to a C grade or higher. Kettering University students enrolled in laboratory courses at our partner German
universities who receive a P grade will be granted credit for the course upon receipt of an official record.
Courses offered at foreign universities and (Kettering University equivalent course):
Please note that this list is subject to change based on the availability of resources at the foreign universities; current
information on courses offered at the foreign universities can be obtained through the OIP.

Financial Considerations
To encourage undergraduate students to participate in the study-abroad programs, Kettering University has agreed to provide
these terms as relatively “cost neutral” when compared to the expenses for tuition, room, board and transportation during a
typical term on campus. Some variation should be expected.
All students who opt for an academic term abroad will register for a study-abroad term at Kettering University and pay the
regular Kettering University tuition.
Study-Abroad Stipends
Kettering University provides up to $1,500 per student as a stipend for study-abroad programs at each degree level. Participants
may use the stipend funding on multiple programs (short-term and term length), but may not exceed the $1,500 total during each
degree program at Kettering. Students must receive class credit during the study-abroad experience to be awarded the stipend.
The amount of the stipend will be determined by the number of credits received from program participation.
Students are able to borrow against this stipend up to three months in advance for a small fee. This loan is intended to provide
students with funds necessary for purchasing round-trip airline tickets, passports, and any other expense that needs to be covered
prior to departure. Several universities abroad require either partial or total housing payment prior to arrival. This payment will
be made by wire transfer and will reduce the amount available.
Orientation
Students enrolled in a study-abroad term are required to attend orientation. The orientation will provide practical, logistical, and
cultural information to prepare for studying and living overseas.
Application
Application materials are posted online via the Blackboard system based on program location. Students are encouraged to make
an appointment with an International Student Coordinator by calling (810) 762-9869 or e-mailing international@kettering.edu to
find out more about completing academic advising for study-abroad and gaining access to the full application. It is favorable to
apply for a program one year in advance of the term a student wishes to study abroad.

International Programs / 68

Short-Term Study-Abroad Programs
In an effort to give students at Kettering University more opportunities to study abroad, the OIP works closely with individual
departments and faculty members to offer short-term study-abroad programs. These programs typically are one to two weeks in
length, and give students the opportunity to experience a new culture while earning credit from Kettering University and
traveling with familiar faculty and staff. Program fees are usually all-inclusive (covering airfare, hotel, up to two meals a day,
and some activity entrance fees) and vary depending on the destination and length of the program.
The Department of Business, in conjunction with the OIP, has spearheaded the initiative to offer short-term programs to students,
offering trips during the Summer and Winter Recesses. Past study-abroad sites include China and London, and future locations
are determined by the department on a yearly basis. Students choosing to earn credit for one class during this program are
eligible for a $375 stipend to assist with costs.
INTERNATIONAL STUDENT RECRUITMENT
The OIP at Kettering University works very closely with the Office of Admissions and the Graduate Office to continuously
recruit international students through strategic partnership with international academic institutions, foreign governments, and
industries.
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AND VISITORS
F-1 Students and Visitors
The F-1 visa is used for students pursuing a degree at an academic or language institution within the United States. International
students in F-1 status are generally enrolled in a full course of study. This visa is intended only for the purpose of study.
J-1 Students and Visitors
The J-1 visa is used for students as well as exchange visitors. At Kettering University, this visa is used for visiting faculty,
research scholars, short-term scholars, and students.
Important Documents for International Students and Visitors
Passport
The Passport is a document issued by your home country government. It is your responsibility to keep your passport valid at all
times. Although passport renewal procedures vary, all passports should be renewed 6 months prior to the expiration date.
I-94 Arrival Departure
U.S. Immigration officials created this record when you entered the United States. It is an electronic record that can be retrieved
online. The I-94 record shows when and where you entered the U.S., your type of visa status and how long you are eligible to
stay in the United States. Students in F-1 or J-1 status are usually allowed to remain in the U.S. for the duration of status (D/S).
The actual ending date of your D/S is the completion date listed on the I-20 or DS-2019 form.
Visa
Visas to enter the United States are issued by an American Consulate abroad (usually in your home country) and are stamped in
your passport. It is not possible to obtain a visa stamp inside the United States. A visa allows the holder to apply for entry into
the United States at the Port of Entry. In issuing a Form I-94 card at the Port of Entry, USCIS gives permission to enter the
United States and grants status. The following information is listed on the visa: date issued; date the visa expires; type of visa;
where it was issued; and how often the visa can be used (multiple or single).
Visitors and students must:
•
Notify the OIP in advance if they terminate their study, employment, or affiliation with Kettering
University earlier than the date indicated on their form I-20 or form DS-2019.
•
Consult with the OIP before traveling to make sure their documents are signed.
•
Obtain approval from the OIP before accepting work at other institutions or off campus.
•
Apply with the OIP in a timely manner, if an extension becomes necessary.
Form I-20 or Form DS-2019
This certificate is an immigration document that indicates a particular immigration status. Form I-20 is used for F-1 students and
F-2 dependents, while form DS-2019 is used for J-1 exchange visitors and J-2 dependents. Even after students have left the
United States, they should retain these documents as they serve as an official record of immigration history. They can also be
useful for tax purposes. Please do not discard old certificates.
SEVIS and Immigration Regulations
SEVIS (Student & Exchange Visitor Information System) is an internet based system in which DHS (Department of Homeland
Security) maintains information on non-immigrant visitors holding visas.

International Programs / 69

OSWALD INTERNATIONAL FACULTY FELLOWSHIPS
The Oswald Fellowships at Kettering University sponsor international travel, teaching, and research opportunities for faculty
members and are made possible by a gift from Kettering alumnus and trustee Bob Oswald ’64 and his wife Marcy.
The purpose of the Oswald International Scholars Program is to increase mutual understanding as well as educational and cultural
exchange involving Kettering faculty members and scholars from international institutions. Applicants are encouraged to reach
out to any international institution, however, preference will be given to applications indicating collaboration with existing
Kettering partners as listed: China at Chongqing Jiaotong University, Xi’an Polytechnic University, Dalian University of
Technology, Tongji University and Yangzhou University; Germany at Reutlingen, Esslingen, Konstanz, Ulm, and Furtwangen;
South Korea at Ajou University and Chungju National University; Sweden at Linköping University; and Turkey at Yeditepe
University.
Through the Oswald International Scholars Program, Kettering University will assist with the costs for Kettering faculty
members to work abroad during their off terms with the expectation that the international partner/host would provide support for
their faculty members to spend time working on the Kettering University campus.
OSWALD INTERNATIONAL STUDENT FELLOWS PROGRAM
The Oswald International Student Fellows Program provides financial grants for travel and living expenses for Kettering students
involved in the international exchange program. Grants are awarded twice each academic year on a competitive basis. In general,
consideration is given to the financial needs of students, the student’s plan for the expenditure of the grant and the country to be
visited. Each spring and fall, up to 8 students per partner university will be selected as Oswald International Student Fellows
based on merit and need. The selected students will receive travel grants of $1,000 to $2,000 in addition to the Kettering travel
stipend provided for study-abroad students.

Program Overview
Mathematics is the universal language of engineering, science, and management. Students majoring in Applied Mathematics at
Kettering University select a concentration in Actuarial Science, Applied and Computational Mathematics, Applied Statistics or
Mathematical Biology. The degree is very flexible in serving the interests of business and industry, preparing the student for a
wide variety of careers. The degree also provides a sound preparation for graduate study. Kettering graduates in Applied
Mathematics appreciate their broad-based education because it enables them to work easily with engineers, managers, and
scientists. They can contribute to team approaches to problem solving.
Students with concentrations in Actuarial Science will study mathematical and statistical methods of certain actuarial models and
the application of those models to insurance and other financial risks. Courses include the early stage of the actuarial exams (P,
FM and MLC). The actuarial science concentration provides excellent preparation for the student interested in starting a career in
the actuarial profession. It is a leading undergraduate level actuarial program by the standards of the Society of Actuaries.
Actuaries are professionals who use mathematics, statistics and financial theory to analyze financial consequences of risk.
Students with concentrations in Applied and Computational Mathematics will study classical and modern mathematical topics
related to scientific and engineering disciplines. Courses are included that emphasize the modeling of physical systems from
theoretical and practical perspectives as well as practical scientific computations. The student will also complete an application
sequence of engineering, science, or computer science courses related to the special interests of the student.
Students with concentrations in Applied Statistics will study modern statistical methods related to the acquisition, organization,
analysis, and interpretation of data. Courses are included that emphasize theory and application of probability, statistics, and
mathematical modeling.
Students with concentrations in Mathematical Biology will study mathematical and statistical methods related to the modeling of
complex biological systems. Theoretical and numerical methods of solution will be applied to ordinary and partial differential
equations and systems of equations arising in General and Human Biology, Anatomy and Physiology, and Ecology.
The curriculum for Applied Mathematics includes core mathematics courses that are common to both concentrations. These
courses make up about one quarter of the total credits in the program. Considerable emphasis is placed on additional core
courses in science, management and humanities.
Applied Mathematics students interact regularly with engineering and science departments through core and other required
courses appropriate to the concentrations in applied and computational mathematics, applied statistics and mathematical biology.
A substantial number of electives provides flexibility for greater breadth or depth of study in mathematics or its applications.
In addition to the major in Applied Mathematics, there are available minors in Applied and Computational Mathematics and
Applied Statistics. Because of the strong mathematical content of Kettering’s other degree programs, it is possible for many
students to complete one of these minors with a modest amount of additional course work.
Program Educational Objectives

Program Overview
Physics is the most fundamental science and underlies the understanding of nearly all areas of science, technology, and
engineering. Physics is concerned with the study of energy, space, time, matter, the interaction between material objects and the
laws that govern these interactions at various scales from sub nano-scale to light-years scale. Physicists study mechanics, sound,
heat, light, electric and magnetic fields, gravitation, relativity, atomic and nuclear physics, solid state physics, wave-like
properties of particles and particle-like properties of radiation. Applied physics is not a specific branch of physics but the
application of all branches of physics to the broad realm of practical problems in scientific and industrial applications, applied
science, and advanced industry. Applied Physics (AP) is the interface between physics, applied sciences and technology;
between the theory, laboratory, and practice. It involves applications of optics, acoustics, and materials in fields such as
nanotechnology, telecommunications, medical physics and devices, or advanced and electronic materials. The Applied Physics
degree is a flexible degree designed to interface physics with applied sciences and engineering disciplines.
The degree in Applied Physics at Kettering University provides excellent preparation for work in industry or in government
agencies. The program also serves as a solid foundation for students desiring to go on to graduate school in physics or any
number of fields in pure and applied science. The curriculum in Applied Physics provides a solid education in mathematics, and
applied sciences and physics with emphasis on the four areas of Applied Optics, Acoustics Materials Science, nanotechnology
and Medical Physics.

Dual Options
One of the advantages of being a Physics major is that because physics leads to or has overlaps with nearly every science and
engineering discipline, it is makes it very easy to pursue a dual option. Pursuing a dual option will create greater flexibility in
terms of future career or graduate studies. When thinking about a dual option as a Physics major please be aware that Kettering
University offers two distinct dual options as described below.
Double Major: Students may earn a double major as part of a single bachelor’s degree by completing all course requirements
for the two majors. If capstone courses are required in both majors, both must be completed. Only one thesis is required. To
pursue a double major, obtain approval from departments for both majors. Both majors will be shown on one diploma and on the
transcript.
Two Degrees: Students may earn two undergraduate degrees simultaneously by completing all course requirements for any two
majors that in combination require at least 28 credits beyond 161 credits. If capstone courses are required in both majors, both
must be completed. Only one thesis is required. To pursue two degrees, obtain approval from departments for both degrees. Two
diplomas will be awarded and both degrees will be shown on the transcript.

Physics Program Concentrations
Applied and Engineering Physics students who wish to obtain a concentration in acoustics, applied optics, medical physics, or
materials science, and have it so designated on their transcript should contact one of the following Professors: Ludwigsen
(Acoustics), Vaishnava (Materials or Medical Physics) or Rablau (Optics). The basic criteria is that to obtain a concentration
students must successfully complete four courses (16 credits) the same as those listed under minor programs (16 credits).
Track of Studies and International Programs
Applied Physics students may utilize the flexibility built in the physics curriculum to use their elective courses toward a
collection of courses in a specific area of engineering or a cohesive collection of science and mathematics courses. This in
particular could be useful in designing a track of study that may facilitate student participation in an existing study abroad
program. This flexibility in the Physics curriculum may also be useful in better planning and preparing for future graduate
studies and career. For further information about this please contact the Physics Department Head at physics@kettering.edu.

Program Overview
Business 2.0 consists of a BSBA degree focused on creating dynamic project leaders capable of taking an idea or process and
either bringing the idea to the market or improving the efficiency and effectiveness of a process.
There are three key aspects to achieving this:
•
Business 2.0 prepares students to work with concept originators/technical colleagues and perform business analyses
related to ideas and processes.
•
Business 2.0 is value-added for the co-op employers as it prepares students to facilitate the idea development process
and perform basic analyses.
•
Business 2.0 allows students the opportunity to hone and practice their ski8lls and knowledge in business studio
(laboratory) experiences.
Students majoring in Business are required to complete the ETS (Educational Testing Service) field test in Business at the
conclusion of their studies for assessment purposes.
The BSBA offers the opportunity to study abroad. Business students wishing to study abroad have the opportunity to attend
classes held in English at Reutlingen University in Reutlingen, Germany. The program is one term in length, normally the SR1
term, and takes place during the fall term. Students interested in studying abroad need to make their decision no later than the
JR1term and discuss their intentions with their academic advisor. Additional information is available from the Department of
Business and the Kettering University Office of International Programs.
The Department of Business offers two minors available to students not majoring in Business. These minors are: Business, and
Innovation and Entrepreneurship.
The Business Minor provides students not majoring in Business with a strong base in the functional areas of business and one
elective course. It also fulfills prerequisites for the Master of Business Administration (MBA), Master of Science (MS) in
Engineering Management, and MS in Operations Management programs offered at Kettering University. In many cases courses
in the business minor will serve prerequisites needs for MBA programs at other institutions.
The Innovation and Entrepreneurship minor is designed for students interested in starting their own business or leading the
creation of new ideas in an existing business.
Since June 18, 1995 the BSBA has been accredited by the Association of Collegiate Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).
ACBSP views this as modification of the current BSBA degree and covers all of the Common Professional Components required
by ACBSP.
The purpose of the BSBA is to prepare students to become dynamic leaders by coupling traditional business subjects with the
ability to interact with technical colleagues and having the soft skills that enable them to lead projects and programs. The BSBA
program provides the strong analytical base needed to analyze managerial, operations, and marketing data.
Program Educational Objectives
1. Graduates will have the knowledge to lead projects in their organizations.
2. Graduates will have the skills and attitudes to be productive employees.

Program Director:

Stacy Seeley, Ph.D.
Room 3-103 MC, 810-762-9561
sseeley@kettering.edu

Program Overview
Chemical engineers apply the principles of chemistry, math, and physics to the design and operation of large-scale chemical
manufacturing processes. They translate processes developed in the lab into practical applications for the production of products
such as plastics, medicines, detergents and fuels; design plants to maximize productivity and minimize costs; and evaluate
operations for performance and product quality.
Chemical Engineers work in very diverse industries including petrochemicals, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, alternative
energy, food, health, automotive, aerospace, and the environment. Chemical Engineers will develop a broad knowledge of
engineering science and environmental regulations, becoming more apt for managing projects of significant proportions.
Chemical Engineers have an integrated approach towards systems and understand the complete process and its critical
components. Chemical engineers affect or control the production of almost every article manufactured on an industrial scale.
Kettering University’s Chemical Engineering Degree Program is a strong interdisciplinary program which draws on the strengths
of our exceptional faculty, curricula, laboratories, and unique co-op component.
Program Educational Objectives
The Chemical Engineering Program is designed to provide its graduates a solid educational foundation on which they can build
successful and sustainable careers in chemical engineering or a related field. In particular, all graduates of the Chemical
Engineering Program will be prepared to do the following:
•
To be employed or pursuing an advanced degree in the field of chemical engineering or other related disciplines.
•
To be productive members of interdisciplinary teams.
•
To assume leadership positions in their industry, their continuing education, or in their communities, as their careers
develop.
•
To continue their professional development and engage in the life-long learning necessary for a sustainable career.

Program Overview
Computer engineering is a branch of engineering concerned with the design, development, and application of computer systems.
The Computer Engineering (CE) program at Kettering University focuses on embedded-computer systems, in which a computer
chip, module, or circuit board is built into a larger product or system. Examples of products containing embedded computers
include “smart” phones, MP3 players, GPS navigation systems, hybrid and electric vehicle drive systems, unmanned vehicles,
medical diagnostic devices, and manufacturing systems. Embedded systems applications span a wide range of industry sectors
including consumer electronics, internet technology, computer hardware, automotive systems, and automated manufacturing.
Computer engineers today can find employment in all these industries, and many more.
The program in Computer Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.

Program Educational Objectives
The Computer Engineering program aims to provide each of its graduates a solid educational foundation on which he/she can
build a successful and sustainable career in computer engineering or a related field. In particular, all graduates of the Computer
Engineering program will have the following:
•

•
•
•

The analysis, design, and documentation skills to qualify them for immediate employment in technical
areas including;
a)
hardware and/or software design of real-time embedded computer systems,
b)
design of complex digital systems, especially computers, and
c)
applications of real-time embedded-computer or other complex digital systems (in, for
example, manufacturing, monitoring, control, or communications).
The teamwork, communications, and interpersonal skills to enable them to be productive members of
interdisciplinary engineering teams.
The skills, confidence, professionalism, and experience to enable them to assume positions of technical
and/or managerial leadership as their careers develop.
A solid foundation in basic mathematics, science, and electrical and computer engineering that will enable
them to continue their professional development and sustain a life-long career in computer engineering,
either through graduate study or continuing self-directed learning and development activities.

The Computer Engineering program is designed to meet its objectives through its curriculum, experiential learning including
cooperative education, and co-curricular activities sponsored by the department and the university.
The curriculum includes a strong sequence of mathematics and basic science courses that provides the solid foundation in these
areas that is common to all engineering programs at Kettering University. Engineering design and basic engineering concepts
from a variety of disciplines are introduced in the freshman year in IME-100. Basic and practical computer programming and
problem solving are introduced, also in the freshman year, in ECE-101.
The “core” curriculum covers hardware design, software development in both assembly and higher-level languages, computer
networking, and embedded computer applications through a combination of computer engineering, electrical engineering, and
computer science courses. Every course in the core curriculum includes a strong laboratory experience, a hallmark of the
program that both enhances students’ learning and hones their abilities to apply technology effectively in the workplace. A
flexible selection of electives allow students to deepen their knowledge in specific areas or applications of computer engineering,
or to broaden their background through dual majors or minors, or simply well chosen combinations of courses that meet their
individual educational goals.
The culminating experience in the curriculum takes place in CE-490 Senior CE Design Project, which gives students experience
working in a team environment to complete a large engineering project that builds on the knowledge and skills they have gained
in their coursework.
The curriculum is supported by modern lab facilities for digital systems, embedded systems, computer networks, haptic systems,
logic systems, parallel computing, mobile robotics, mobile application development, circuits, and electronics.

Program Overview
Computer science touches virtually every aspect of human endeavor. Its impact on society is seen in the proliferation of
computers, information systems, game systems, web browsers, search engines, and all the wonderful application programs that
have been developed to make computers more productive and easier to use. An important aspect of the field deals with how to
make programming easier, software more reliable, and the processing and retrieval of information more accessible, but
fundamentally, computer science is a science of abstraction - creating the correct models for real-world problems that can be
represented and manipulated inside a computer.
Computer scientists are experts on the subject of computation and information representation, both in terms of the theory of the
fundamental capabilities and limitations of computation, as well as how computation can be practically realized and applied. A
computer scientist understands how to design and analyze algorithms that apply computation effectively, and how to represent,
store, and retrieve information efficiently, and how to design software systems to solve complex problems.
The program for Computer Science majors is broad and rigorous; students are required to have a solid foundation in computer
software, hardware, and theory. Yet, the program is structured in a way that supports in-depth study of areas in and outside the
computing field. Technical and free electives give students the opportunity to take advanced courses in areas of computer science
such as information retrieval, computer graphics, cryptography, computer and network security, and artificial intelligence;
students may elect to concentrate their studies in computer gaming, or system and data security; students can easily obtain minors
in diverse fields such as applied mathematics, economics, computer engineering, and literature.
A wide variety of exciting professional and academic opportunities exist for graduates of computer science including software
engineering, Internet systems and technology, security, hardware development, information systems, biotechnology, business,
and consulting, as well as masters and doctoral studies in computing related fields. With the aid of a Computer Science faculty
advisor, the computer science student is expected to put together a coherent program of study that supports career objectives and
is true to the aims of a liberal education.
The program in Computer Science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.

Computer Science vs. Computer Engineering
Historically, the discipline of computer science draws its roots from two separate disciplines.
•
Electrical Engineering: the development of devices that depend on electricity and magnetism.
•
Mathematics: the study of the properties and interactions of idealized objects, such as numbers and symbols.
Computer science lies at the intersection of these two disciplines. It is the study of a particular class of electrical devices (i.e.
computers) which can perform mathematical, logical operations (i.e. software).
The computer engineering and computer science programs have a common core of classes. Students in both programs study
programming, the design of digital systems, computer architecture, and operating systems, as well as a solid foundation in
mathematics, science, and general education.
The computer engineering program emphasizes the design and development of physical computer systems. In addition to a
common engineering core, students in computer engineering study topics such as the analysis of electrical circuits, and
electronics, with an emphasis on electrical and digital design.
The computer science program emphasizes the design and development of software systems. Students in computer science study
topics such as algorithms and data structures, software engineering, compiler design, database systems, artificial intelligence, and
the theoretical foundations of computation.
Both programs prepare students for work in the computer industry, though with emphasis on different areas. Students should
select the program which fits their skills and interests best. Both programs offer minors, so students may take additional courses
in these areas and have it designated on their transcript.

Program Overview
Electrical Engineering is a broad engineering discipline that integrates mathematical and scientific principles of electricity and
magnetism to analyze electrical phenomena and to design electrical systems. The Electrical Engineering program prepares
students for a wide range of careers involving design and implementation of electrical systems.
The program in Electrical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.

Program Educational Objectives
The Electrical Engineering program is designed to provide its graduates a solid educational foundation on which they can build
successful and sustainable careers in electrical engineering or a related field. In particular, all graduates of the Electrical
Engineering program will have the following:
•
The analysis, synthesis and design skills to qualify them for immediate employment or graduate study in the
areas of electrical, electronic and digital systems.
•
The teamwork, communications and interpersonal skills to enable them to be productive members of
interdisciplinary engineering teams.
•
The confidence, professionalism and experience to enable them to assume positions of technical and/or
managerial leadership as their careers develop.
•
A solid foundation in basic mathematics, science and electrical engineering that will enable them to continue
their professional development and sustain a life-long career in electrical engineering, either through
advanced course work or continuing self-directed learning and development activities.
The Electrical Engineering program is designed to meet its objectives through its curriculum, experiential learning including
cooperative education, and co-curricular activities sponsored by the department and the university.
The curriculum includes a strong sequence of mathematics and basic science courses that provides the solid foundation in these
areas that is common to all engineering programs at Kettering University. Engineering design and basic engineering concepts
from a variety of disciplines are introduced in the freshman year in IME-100. Basic and practical computer programming and
problem solving is introduced, also in the freshman year, in ECE-101.
The “core” curriculum include fundamental courses in electrical circuits, electronics, electrical signals and systems,
electromagnetic, fields and waves, digital systems, and embedded computer systems. Fully half of the courses in the core
curriculum include a strong laboratory experience, which both enhances students’ learning and hones their abilities to apply
technology effectively in the workplace. A flexible selection of electives allow students to deepen their knowledge in specific
areas or applications of electrical engineering, or to broaden their background through dual majors or minors, or simply well
chosen combinations of courses that meet their individual educational goals.
The culminating experience in the curriculum takes place in EE-490 Senior EE Design Project, which gives students experience
working in a team environment to complete a large engineering project that builds on the knowledge and skills they have gained
in their coursework.
The curriculum is supported by modern lab facilities for analog and digital circuits and electronics, electrical machines, power
electronics, control systems, high-voltage studies, haptic systems, and embedded computer systems.

Program Overview
Physics is the most fundamental science and underlies the understanding of nearly all areas of science, technology, and
engineering. Physics is concerned with the study of energy, space, time, matter, the interaction between material objects and the
laws that govern these interactions at various scales from sub nano-scale to light-years scale. Physicists study mechanics, sound,
heat, light, electric and magnetic fields, gravitation, relativity, atomic and nuclear physics, solid state physics, wave-like
properties of particles and particle-like properties of radiation. Engineering physics is not a specific branch of physics but the
application of all branches of physics to the broad realm of practical problems in scientific and industrial settings, engineering
design and applications, applied science, and advanced industry. Engineering Physics (EP) is the interface of physics with
specific areas of advanced or emerging technology, which are not covered in depth under the traditional engineering education
such as applications of optics, acoustics, and materials in fields such as nanotechnology, telecommunications, medical physics
and devices, or advanced and electronic materials. Engineering Physics degree is a flexible degree designed to interface physics
with applied sciences and engineering disciplines.
The degree in Engineering Physics (EP) at Kettering University unifies the Physics knowledge applications in optics, acoustics,
and advanced materials with a comprehensive engineering component emphasizing the systems engineering approach to prepare
graduates for engineering applications in emerging technology. The well balanced curriculum in Engineering Physics provides
a solid education combined with desirable skills that could lead to a career in industry and government sector as well as graduate
studies in applied sciences and engineering.

Dual Options
One of the advantages of being a Physics major is that because physics leads to or has overlaps with nearly every science and
engineering discipline, it is makes it very easy to pursue a dual option. Pursuing a dual option will create greater flexibility in
terms of future career or graduate studies. When thinking about a dual option as a Physics major please be aware that Kettering
University offers two distinct dual options as described below.
Double Major: Students may earn a double major as part of a single bachelor’s degree by completing all course requirements
for the two majors. If capstone courses are required in both majors, both must be completed. Only one thesis is required. To
pursue a double major, obtain approval from departments for both majors. Both majors will be shown on one diploma and on the
transcript.
Two Degrees: Students may earn two undergraduate degrees simultaneously by completing all course requirements for any two
majors that in combination require at least 28 credits beyond 161 credits. If capstone courses are required in both majors, both
must be completed. Only one thesis is required. To pursue two degrees, obtain approval from departments for both degrees. Two
diplomas will be awarded and both degrees will be shown on the transcript.

For further information please contact the Physics Department Head at physics@kettering.edu.
Physics Program Concentrations
Applied and Engineering Physics students who wish to obtain a concentration in acoustics, applied optics, medical physics, or
materials science, and have it so designated on their transcript should contact one of the following Professors: Ludwigsen
(Acoustics), Vaishnava (Materials or Medical Physics) or Rablau (Optics). The basic criteria is that to obtain a concentration
students must successfully complete four courses (16 credits) the same as those listed under minor programs (16 credits).
Track of Studies and International Programs
Engineering Physics students may utilize the flexibility built in the physics curriculum to use their elective courses toward a
collection of courses in a specific area of engineering or a cohesive collection of science and mathematics courses. This in
particular could be useful in designing a track of study that may facilitate student participation in an existing study abroad
program. This flexibility in the Physics curriculum may also be useful in better planning and preparing for future graduate
studies and career. For further information about this please contact the Physics Department Head at physics@kettering.edu.

Engineering Electives are any 300 or 400 level Engineering or Applied Sciences courses approved by the academic advisor to form a sequence
of courses in a specific Engineering or technical field of study (in some cases, this may also include one or more courses in Science, Math, or
Business necessary to complete an engineering sequence, such as fuel cell sequence). Engineering sequence courses will be designed based on
individual student interests and their future career or graduate studies plans and in some cases may satisfy a minor program requirements.

Program Overview
The Department of Industrial & Manufacturing Engineering offers a degree in Industrial Engineering. The department
emphasizes development of the student’s ability to analyze operational requirements and to design processes that systematically
integrate customer needs, technology, and economic and social factors for industrial, service, and governmental organizations.
Industrial Engineering (IE) is a discipline known for its breadth of scope and application. The preparation received in industrial
engineering is valuable in virtually all industrial, commercial and governmental activities which are engaged in the manufacture
of a product or the provision of a service. Graduates typically are responsible for the design of integrated systems at one of two
levels.
The first level may be described as the “human activity systems” level and is concerned with the design of the physical
workplace at which human activity occurs. The second level, the “management control system” level, is concerned with
planning, measuring and controlling the activities of the organization for the optimal utilization of its resources. The utilization
of computers and the development of the associated software are integral parts of both levels of systems design. Industrial
Engineers are concerned with systematic design and integration of people, raw materials, facilities, information, and energy to
produce safe and quality products and/or services at an affordable cost to the consumer.
The Industrial Engineering curriculum develops both the engineering theory and the practical background and people skills
necessary to design optimal productive work and management control systems for an organization. The Industrial Engineering
curriculum is designed to provide the student with a sound theoretical background while being oriented toward applied problemsolving. Classroom instruction is backed by hands-on application in well-equipped laboratory facilities in Computer Graphics,
Computer Software Development, Human Factors (ergonomics), Manufacturing Materials and Processes, Methods Analysis,
Networked Microcomputers, and Physical Simulation.
The program in Industrial Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org.

Program Educational Objectives
During the 5-8 years following completion of the Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering Degree, our graduates will:
•
Use principles of Industrial Engineering to work successfully with a variety of people to further the aims and
objectives of themselves, their organization and others.
•
Grow professionally, having increased their level of authority, contribution, leadership and teamwork.
•
Demonstrate their ability to increase their knowledge in ways most appropriate for their goals.

Dual Degrees in Industrial Engineering and Mechanical Engineering
A coordinated program is available to earn both a Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering and a Bachelor of Science in
Mechanical Engineering in 193 credits (189 credits of course work and 4 thesis credits). A student can complete the program in
10 or 11 academic terms at Kettering University. During the first three terms, a student can follow the representative program for
either degree. The following representative program is intended as a guide to assist the student in planning for the remaining
terms. An eligible student may be able to avoid a SR-V term by one of the following three methods: 1) take 5 courses per term
for one term prior to JR-1, 2) take 6 courses per term for one term after SO-II, or 3) take Kettering or guest courses during a work
term. It is the student's responsibility to determine that all requirements are satisfied for both programs. The student must be
advised by both programs each term.

Mechanical Engineering Program Specialties
Students majoring in Mechanical Engineering may select a specialty consisting of 20 credit hours of courses focused in a
particular area. Specialties may include both required and elective courses. First Six Semesters are common to all Mechanical
Engineering Students. SR I through SR III representative programs are given for each specialty.
A Mechanical Engineering specialty provides students a depth of study in preparation for a career within an industrial sector
and/or as a foundation for graduate study. However, the student’s degree is Mechanical Engineering and the selected specialty
does not prevent students from working within any industry. The primary advantage is to provide a “jump start” over mechanical
engineering graduates from other schools with traditional degree programs. Courses are subject to cancellation due to low
enrollment.

INNOVATION–TO-ENTREPRENEURSHIP COURSE OF STUDY (i2e-CS)
The “Innovation-to-Entrepreneurship Course of Study” (i2e-CS) is a critical component of the i2e-Across the University program
(i2e-AU) whereby an in-depth, cohesive and contiguous thread of courses will serve as a major curricular component of i2e-AU.

i2e-AU VISION
Kettering graduates will know that they can change the world because they are equipped with a compelling combination of:
•
•
•

strong technical skills,
tested work ethic, and
agile entrepreneurial mindset.

i2e-AU MISSION
To provide Kettering students with a combination of curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular pathways for developing and
practicing an innovation and entrepreneurial mindset that is valuable for diverse careers in large corporations, high-risk start-ups
and social enterprises.

PROGRAM GOALS AND OVERVIEW
Innovation-to-Entrepreneurship Course of Study (i2e-CS) is an 18-credit elective sequence developed to ensure that students
receive, in an immersion style, academic and practical exposure to innovation and entrepreneurship mindset. This course of study
is designed based on the following fundamental principles:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Hybrid curricular, co-curricular and extra-curricular pathways
Exposure in every school term
Development & practice of entre/intrapreneurship mindset
Multi-disciplinary synergy
Faculty coaching & peer-to-peer mentorship
Course credit for students
Recognition for students

The sequencing of the courses progresses from exposure to innovation activities (e.g. engineering design and applied science) in
the Freshman year to an inquisitive exploration of the mindset and activities of successful and failed innovators and entrepreneurs
in the Sophomore year. Meanwhile, the students are gradually encouraged and shown ways of recognizing opportunities and
developing innovative ideas. In combination with peer-to-peer networking (through KES) and faculty mentorship, the students
will continue to develop their innovation ideas through the Junior year while developing the broader mindset of intrapreneurship
and venture development. This course of study will also provide a strong linkage for project ideas gathered/sponsored through the
Center for Culminating Undergraduate Experience (CCUE). During the Senior year, the students will engage in skunkworks and
prototyping activities with an eye on developing business models and commercialization pathways (or intra-corporate acceptance
pathways) for their innovative ideas and/or products. The i2e-Creativity Lab (T-Space) will be available to support these
activities.

PRE-MED EDUCATION COURSE OF STUDY
It’s all about options and increasing your opportunities to be successful. Getting an engineering or science undergraduate degree
can be taken to the next level with a Pre-Med Course of Study. This is ideal for students who are considering medical school, a
job in the growing Biotechnical industry, or continuing their education in graduate school. Medicine is becoming an increasingly
technical field; an engineering or science degree and the Pre-Med Course of Study can prepare you to be a great doctor, medical
researcher, or designer of tomorrow’s lifesaving technologies.
Two of Kettering’s programs already include the specific courses required for entrance into most medical schools: Biochemistry
and Chemistry. Students in any of the other degree programs can obtain the required courses by completing the Biochemistry
minor, a year of Physics, and a year of Biology to obtain the most common Medical School prerequisites which are as follows:
•

One year of General Chemistry: CHEM-135/136 or CHEM-137/136, CHEM-237/238
Students may take General Chemistry I, CHEM-137 and CHEM-136, Principles of Chemistry Lab or CHEM135/136 for their first term of chemistry. Principles of Chemistry, CHEM-135/136 is already part of the typical
Engineering curricula. A second term of General Chemistry must be taken (i.e. CHEM-237/238).

•

One year of Organic Chemistry: CHEM-345/346, CHEM-347/348
Industrial Organic Chemistry which is included in the Engineering curricula is not considered sufficient for most
Medical Schools. Two terms of Organic Chemistry (i.e. CHEM-345/346 and CHEM-347/348) must be taken.

•

One year of Biology: BIOL-141/142, BIOL-241/242
Students must take General Biology Lecture + Lab and Human Biology Lecture + Lab.

•

One-half year of Biochemistry: CHEM-351/352
The two Organic Chemistry and one Biochemistry courses comprise the Biochemistry Minor. As such, students
completing the Premedical Education Course of Study will earn a Biochemistry Minor which will be listed on
their transcript. The Premedical Education Course of Study will not appear on the transcript.

•

One year of Physics: PHYS-114/115, PHYS-224/225

Other requirements for most medical schools, such as one year of college math and courses in liberal studies, are already included
within all the degree programs. Students can typically utilize free or technical electives to take a portion of the credits in the PreMed Course of Study. For a sample curriculum for your degree program that incorporates the pre-med course of study, see your
degree program department chair or Dr. Stacy K. Seeley (pre-med coordinator). In addition to the Pre-Med Course of Study,
Engineering students are typically required to take a Senior Capstone Course (sometimes referred to as a Senior Project Course)
to complete their Major Degree course requirements. The typical Engineering student pursuing the Pre-Med Course of Study will
require more credits (~8 credits) than a given Engineering Program—refer to your department degree program requirements for
complete details. The typical Medical School does not usually require other courses (e.g. Anatomy & Physiology or Psychology).
However, students planning on applying to specific medical schools must consult the given medical school for further details.

Minors / 141

MINORS
A minor is an area of concentrated study, typically outside of the major area of study. A minor requires a minimum of four
classes (16 credits) in a directed area of study. Minors may require coursework beyond the minimum of 41 classes (161 credits)
required for completion of the major. Coursework taken outside of Kettering University is not transferable towards a
minor. Minors are not required for graduation though a student may elect to pursue a minor in an area of additional interest.
Minors appear on a student’s transcript at student declaration, and requirements must be completed at the time of graduation. The
Academic Department granting the minor provides an audit for each student who applies to graduate.

Endowed Chairs
Endowed chairs are among the traditional hallmarks of the best institutions of higher education and Kettering University is
particularly proud to have been singled out for five such chairs since its independence. Outstanding teacher/scholars are named
to hold these distinguished positions--to the benefit of students throughout the University.
The Frances Willson Thompson Chair of Leadership Studies was established by Mrs. Thompson of Flint, Michigan. It
memorializes the role that members of her family have played in the development of American industry, particularly William C.
Durant and Governor Henry Howland Crapo.
The Eugene W. Kettering Chair of Power Engineering, was endowed by the Kettering Fund of Dayton, Ohio, in honor of Eugene
W. Kettering who had a distinguished career in the field of diesel locomotion and was a prominent philanthropist.
The F. James McDonald Chair of Industrial Management was endowed by nearly 700 GM dealers throughout the United States
in honor of Mr. McDonald’s many contributions to the automotive industry. A 1944 graduate of GMI/Kettering, Mr. McDonald
is retired president of General Motors Corporation.
The Alfred Grava Chair in Manufacturing Management was endowed by Dr. and Mrs. Martin (Skip) Walker to honor the late Al
Grava. Walker, a 1954 GMI graduate and former chairman/CEO of the M.A. Hanna Company, and Grava, a 1957 GMI graduate
and former president of Masco-Tech Automotive Systems Group, were classmates at GMI and lifelong friends.
The Robert and Claire Reiss Chair of Industrial Engineering was established by Robert E. Reiss and his wife Claire. Bob is a
1960 Industrial Engineering graduate and former member of the university’s Board of Trustees. He was President and CEO of
Interventional Technologies, a company he founded and later sold to Boston Scientific. The chair focuses on both teaching and
research within an area of concentration relating to industrial engineering.
